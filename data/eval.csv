I guess I will just start off with a little background. My girlfriend of almost two years and I have been separated for about 2 mos. now. We haven't talked since and I've been sitting in a pool of guilt because of why we broke up. Basically, we broke up because I felt she would be happier (and she seems to be) without me. I guess I also had some selfish intentions of my own. Now after a shit storm that I've created with the other people I love (family, friends, coaches) I got a wake up call and reality has set in. I am still in love with her and I miss her but I took her for granted. It wasn't the first time I've fucked up like this but not quite to this extent. I even have a hard time writing this because I don't even feel I deserve advice to earn her back... Especially after how I have spent the couple months away from her (Made out with a girl when I was drunk). I can't expect her to come running back to me after I tell her that. Maybe she is better without me.

this guy (23m), who i am now good friends with, and i (22f) dated a few months back. i had just gotten out of a long and dramatic relationship and was finally feeling like i was getting over my ex. i wasn't looking for anything serious when i started dating this friend, (who i had just met and didn't know anything about my past) but he continuously told me how much he liked me and how beautiful he thought i was. because of this i was a little reserved with him because i didn't want to hurt him since i didn't think i was in any place to be in a relationship with anybody. maybe he sensed my reservation, i don't know, but about a month in out of the blue he tells me he realizes he doesn't like me anymore and doesn't want a relationship because he needs to figure his own shit out (he was about to finish college and unemployed at the time). fast forward to now, (about 7-8 months later) and we stayed friends. my personal feelings for him, however, have steadily grown. i don't know if i should say anything to him, but i can't help but feel like we would be amazing together. he's the nicest guy i've ever known, and we get along great as friends. also the sex we had was great, so i doubt physical attraction is a problem with us (there's always been an underlying tension of sexual attraction..) i'm afraid he'll tell me he's never had real feelings for me, that the time we dated was a fluke and that will in turn ruin our friendship. it's driving me absolutely crazy not knowing for sure though, so i don't know what to do.

So, where to begin. This might be long. Me: 32 male Maria: 39 female Met Maria a year and a half ago. She got me out of rut. Maria is the hottest person I've ever seen, I'm a 6, she's a 10. I'm realistic, I'm not putting myself down. And I'm a very confident guy. We have been together just over a year. Things are generally dandy. She has two friends, among others. 1 ex boyfriend, 1 ex friend with benefits. She hangs out with them once in a while, and refuses to introduce me. Says that the ex boyfriend is just not ready to meet me. Says that he was her only friend she had for many years so she cannot forget about him; they must remain friends. I have a hard time NOT seeing her perspective; she's not wrong. Plus the guy actually seems like a nice dude. But maybe I'm being too trusting. The ex friend with benefits: she normally tells me she hung out with him. Have caught her (unintentionally caught, have not confronted, don't know how or if there is a need) via text message indicating that they hung out, but she didn't tell me about this instance. This instance was also at 2 AM. The 2am thing bothers me, which is why I bring it up. No actual evidence of anything else though. Both men definitely still like or even love her. I generally trust this woman. She tells me she loves me, talks marriage, I know her family well, her family knows me. I am having issues dealing with this. It keeps me up at night. What do I do reddit? Do I ask her what is going on, if anything happened? If so, how? Do I just up and leave? Right back to my rut :-/ Rut is because I work like 14 hour days, no time for friends or much of any social life. But that's another subreddit issue. Do I continue because I'm paranoid and am just turning into a controlling asshole? Throwaway because.

The title probably sounded really stupid, but this is becoming a genuine issue for me and I'm really unsure of how to handle it. I'm a female in the military. I'm also in a combat arms unit which is mostly male. Like many military personnel, I'm concise and direct in how I speak. This wouldn't be an issue as that is totally fine in the military, except that it's combined with two other little issues: first, I don't smile a lot. It's just not something I do. There's no particular reason for it, other than simply being a serious person. I never really noticed it until it was pointed out to me. Second, apparently I have horrible resting bitch face. I get harassed to smile on pretty much a daily basis. Sometimes it's just an annoying comment on how I should smile more, but sometimes it's people withholding items that I need until I smile for them. I have spoken up and said that I don't appreciate being talked to that way, but that combined with my (apparently) angry face has given me a reputation as a huge bitch. Plus, people don't want to talk to me or get to know me because of my face. A few folks have actually talked to me and every one of them has commented that they were surprised I was so friendly, because my face always looked so angry. The major problem seems to just be my face and I have no idea why it looks so angry all the time. I'm not trying to look mad at all. I'm tired of being seen as a huge bitch or as someone who is having personal issues because I always look angry or upset. I try to joke about it but this shit is getting really old. How the hell do I get coworkers off my back when it comes to pressuring me to smile? Is there a cure for resting bitch face? It's really getting annoying.

Backstory: I've been with my company for a year. Almost 5 months ago we hired a new staff member and we became fast friends. I kept telling myself I shouldn't pursue him romantically because we're coworkers and I'd ruin our friendship and make things awkward, but as you can see from the title, he was thinking the same thing and now we're going for it. I swear even though I spend 9 hours a day at work with him, lunch breaks, and time on weekends, I cannot get enough of him. Never once has he even mildly annoyed me, and on top of everything I have going on right now, he has been nothing short of kind, supportive, patient, and amazing. I can't sing his praises enough and we are seriously two peas in a pod. I did consider that this may be different from our other past relationships though because he's never dated a white woman and I've never dated an Asian guy before. (I'm mostly white, only a quarter Korean). Neither of us cares about the racial difference, but I am wondering if any redditors have experience with Asian male/white female relationships. I ask because his parents are both Korean and live in Korea even though he grew up in the states. I'm just looking for anecdotal stories or any advice if you think there's anything specifically useful to know. Also if there's a different subreddit I should ask this to, please point me in that direction.

My boyfriend and I are both born again Christian. I guess he has a more deeper relationship with the Almighty than I do. I believe in Him its just that I dont practice everything especially the ""NO to premarital sex"". Boyfriend and I have great sex. We go to church everytime we could and recently one of the preach was about how a person who is wordly thinks vs a person who has faith with God lives. A person who has faith with God wont do premarital sex as it is a sin. Boyfriend and I felt bad but I brushed it off easily and we were still having awesome sex until today, he said he didnt want to have sex anymore. Its fine with me if this is what he wants and what he thinks is best for our relationship.... but how do I transition to this??? He said he is really serious about this. he said he enjoys having sex with me but he just wants to make things right. I kind of feel unattractive that maybe he doesnt want me anymore but he said that isnt the case. I dont know what to do? I want to be accepting of the lifestyle change he wants but how do I transition to this????? anyone ever experienced this?

Basically me and my GF where together for 2 ears and loved each other a lot one day without really any warning she told me that because of the distance (we are sort of long distance more just mid distance but being in school only get weekends) that she felt like I was only her boyfriend on weekends and that she had started falling for another guy, anyway we broke up and about a week later she is with him. Now thats not what my problems is I am dealing with that and who knows maybe we will even get back together. my problem is I cannot stop fantasising over her and her new boyfriend fucking and I imagine it constantly it both turns me on weirdly and makes me feel horrific inside as she is fucking someone else. It has gotten to the point where I know he is round at 1:00 and I see her go off facebook for 1 hour then post something then go off again I just can't stop thinking that he has just fucked her (she used to most of the time check facebook whilst we where cuddling after sex). I also masturbait to pictures of her she sent me from when we went out (nude) along with pictures of her and him together I know its wrong I just don't know how to stop.

My coworker (35ish) of 6 years was 9 months pregnant, and she lost the baby. I (31) only found out through Facebook, and sent her and her family my condolences. When she came back after a few months, it seemed like she was avoiding me. We were not that close, but there aren't that many women at our job who have kids (ours are the same age, we were pregnant together 5 years ago) and generally the same outlook on life and work. So I've only seen her a few times since then and today I caught her in the hallway with an unrelated question. We started talking about a situation with an old boss we both had, and the topic of kids came up. I think I fumbled when I mentioned that boss came to see me when my daughter was born, and then she made an excuse and left. I don't want to bring up her lost pregnancy/baby, but I want to acknowledge her pain and tell her that I was thinking of her. She seems to want to be very private about it, and I am uncomfortable bringing up a hard topic. At the same time, I know it can be weird when you are going through a hard time, and people you to act normal. So can anyone advise on me what to do? Should I drop it and be more careful not to mention baby-stuff? Write a note? Let her avoid me for 3 more months?

Background: My girlfriend and I live with my parents. I'm a nurse and make a decent salary - I was going to move out, however my mom talked us into staying for a little while longer. I've always felt as if I was ""walking on eggshells"" with my mom. Today I was at work when I got a frantic voicemail from my girlfriend. I call her back and she's in hysterics - absolutely bawling her eyes out. We have a 13 week old puppy, Macy. She found a way to open the backyard door and decided to jump into the pool. My girlfriend heard her screeching and saw her starting to sink so she jumped in fully clothed to save her. The puppy is fine, and we've completely reinforced the doors so this won't happen again. My girlfriend is still very shook up. My girlfriend mentioned that my mom only seemed to care about the pool liner. She didn't care about her or Macy at all. I shot off a quick text to my mom saying ""Heard about pup. Be glad she's ok. Pool liner is replaceable, she isn't."" Dad gets home and that text has upset her greatly (she was crying at work). She says the events happened a little differently: Macy fell in, girlfriend jumped in to save her, and after making sure they were both okay she simply stated ""I hope the liner's ok."" When my mom got home from work she wouldn't talk to me. She says my text was rude, and how she's hurt my girlfriend and I would even think that. She was quite aggressive & yelling as she did so. She's not talking to me anymore aside from short, one worded answers. Girlfriend will be home from work soon so I'll be able to get her side of things. I feel awful. What do I do?

SO and I had been together for 9 months; in the beginning of May we broke up and had a 3 week break;and during that time went back and forth trying to resolve concerns that led to our split. We have now reconciled; but I know during the time we weren't together he was pursuing a relationship with another woman and she was in his home. We have decided to move forward and disregard what occurred during thoses 3 weeks and work on our relationship. I now feel overwhelming anxiety when staying overnight at his house. I'm uncomfortable knowing another woman was there in my absence. The bedroom is the worse; and I have currently asked not to stay there; retreating to the spare bedroom instead for overnight stays.

My TA is a PhD grad student in the same field I currently study in undergrad. I've only known him since the beginning of this semester (around Sept). He's the nerdy, more reserved type, and he's brilliant at solving equations and abstract thinking. Meanwhile, I have to put in a lot of effort to understand the material, and end up asking him a lot of questions in office hours. He's very patient, but I'm scared I'm increasingly coming across as an idiot. We had a midterm last week, and he's handing them back sometime soon. I don't know how to handle the embarrassment if I did poorly, especially after going to his office hours for help so many times. The class is small too, so there's no chance of just ""blending in"" with the crowd either.

I've been dating my current girlfriend for about a year and half and just two months ago we continued our relationship long distance in order to accomidate going to different schools (about 1.5 hours apart). Anyway, last night she texted me that she doesn't think it will work out because I'm not there. That is literally the only thing, she would rather have somebody there who she can touch rather than continue a loving, long relationship that has potential. I'm trying to talk to her and she is telling me that although she loves me, she doesn't romantically love me as much anymore because of the distance. I've done everything right that I can control in a LDR, but the one thing I can't control backfires on me and blows everything up. For most people this wouldn't be a huge deal, but she was my first everything. Before her, I was a scrawny, acne ridden kid who would rarely go out and be social. She is more of a socialite and we met in a class my junior year. She changed me so much. I'm much more outgoing now and being able to talk to her has kept my morals high at a college where I'm not social (not b/c I haven't tried, it just isn't safe because of crime). I want to transfer and continue our relationship, but everybody I've talked to says that isn't a solution. I'm afraid of relapsing back into the person I used to be, which scares me so much. She brought out all the best in me, and without her I doubt I will be very energetic or enthusiastic about college. She changed everything for me, and losing that catalyst has me so scared for myself. I would appreciate any advice regarding transferring, getting her to accomidate the LDR more, or really any advice in general. ** Don't comment ""Don't transfer for a girl, it won't work out anyway."" I've heard that too many times. Thanks.

I lived with both my parents until I was 8 years old, then with my maternal grandmother (for 2 years), then with my mom and stepdad (3 years), then they got arrested for drugs and I went to live in foster care with friends' (two homes, two different friends) family from age 13 to 19. My foster care experience was better than most. (And my bio-dad and stepdad both have passed away from drug-associated health problems). My mom and I began reconciling about 15 years ago when she got clean/sober and it's been a bumpy ride but we have a cordial, if strained relationship now. I'd like to maintain having holidays with her and her health is failing, so I visit most weeks on Sundays for a few hours. These Sunday visits are often tense, with me waiting for her to blow up about something, and she sends emotional daggers towards me. The biggest one being: to this day, my mom insists I ran away from home (and often says it in mixed company or in public arguments, very embarrassing and loud), or in her words, ""left her"" when I was 13. I never quite understood why she thought that. She says that I abandoned her and she guilts me about what 13-year-old me did. Yesterday, I heard even more background-- she thinks that I ran away to live with my friend and completely blocked out her arrest and that social services took me away-- she even pre-dates when I ran away to be earlier than the ""arrest"" she barely remembers. I've never run away from home. I don't know how to react when she pulls these yelly tantrums. I want to just walk out the door when it happens because I cringe and cry and get all red in the face and angry. And If I tell her she's wrong and she ""needs a new narrative,"" she says that I'm lying about what happened. But I was the sober one! What are some alternatives to walking away or what is a new way I can react/act towards her that maybe I haven't considered?

So I've been dating her for two months. It's been a bit rocky for the last month. My dad just back from a trip. I sent her a snap saying I'd be sending her a selfie of my dad and I saying hi to her if that's cool. She started typing but didn't send anything. I figured it'd be fine, I hav a tendency to overthink these things. We sent a quick little snap introducing my dad to her. She opened it, no response. I checked Facebook today and I only see her profile pic. According to FB she and I are friends, but yeah can't see other photos of her or posts on her timeline. It's midnight now so no sense in me trying to contact her until tomorrow. Looking for either wisdom related to what this scenario could mean, or a few words of compassion. This is my first girlfriend, and if this is a breakup it's gonna suck... But she's a cool chick, and I really enjoyed the time I had with her. But yeah, words of compassion would be appreciated if this is looking bad. Obviously I'll call her tomorrow at lunch and see what's going on.

We have been together for close to a year now. He will be 31 next month and still lives with his parents. He never finished high school. He has had plenty of jobs in his lifetime, everything from working for tips to 17 bucks an hour. He usually doesnt keep the same job for more than 2 years. The reasons he gives me for leaving various jobs all seem to be very childish. For example, he quit the job he had when we first met because we got in a fight and he packed his bags and started driving to a different city just to prove a point. When I gave in he turned around and came back. After that he got a job at a retail store. Quit that one a couple months ago because he was ""no longer getting praise for his hard work"" and he couldn't ""work with the new idiots they hired"". We are now working together for a cleaning company. The boss has recently made us come in earlier in the morning. He spent the whole day saying if the boss doesn't understand that he can't come in before 9 a.m he will look for a new job that doesn't require him to wake up so early. When he is at home he just plays video games and sits on the computer. He tells me he would like to get his GED but there is no way he can sit threw a class. He is extremely impatient. When we had a pregnancy scare we went to the food stamps office and he was only able to wait 10 mins before he had had enough. He declared bankruptcy last year and traded his car in for a cheaper one. We barely have money to pay his bills. I don't have bills (thank goodness). I am very much in love with him despite his laziness. He is a smart man, he speaks 3 languages, he's AMAZING with people....I know if he really tried he could make something of himself. He is 30, I would like to marry him like we have planned before he turns 40 but at this point we don't even have money for gas let alone an independent life together without the help of our folks. What can I do to motivate him? Am i just wasting my time?

Hey relationship sub, this isn't my first post but they are often throwaway as my reddit is known by friends. My girlfriend of two and a half years suddenly dropped the news three weeks ago that she felt a relationship was weighing her down and she wants time out of a relationship. It came after only a week of slight hints that this was coming. She did all this over a text message and treated me like utter trash so all I want to know is, why do I want to talk to this girl? She wasn't cheating on me but rather convinced by her new friend and her friends boyfriend that I was pretty much dead weight. She never replied to the last message I sent to her the night of the breakup yet she often re views it as Facebook shows the most recent view. My entire family has shunned her actions and have no intent on ever knowing her again but why do I still want to just say ""Hey .., how are you?"". I know I'll never date her again but for some reason I want her as a friend even though she crushed me? Thanks everyone!

I've made some posts before under a different username about my deteriorating relationship. We've been together for 9 years now and have 2 daughters (5 & 9) together. We've been distant from each other ever since she got pregnant with our youngest daughter. I'm fairly confident that she only ever wanted to be with me so she could have the kids she always wanted. So things have been pretty shitty for a long time now. I've been banished to sleep in our basement guest bed for the last 4 years. Any sort of physical contact between us ended about a year or so ago. We can barely stand to be around each other any more. We've finally decided to officially end things since this is hardly a good environment to raise our 2 daughters in. Here is where the problem comes in. She has been in college since before we met. She finally got her associates degree last year. As of this fall, she started a bachelors program at a college about 1.5 hours away. She expects to be done with that in about another 1.5-2 years. Until then, the only income she has is from her SSDI disability payments due to her extreme bi-polar and anxiety. No where near enough to afford an apartment on her own. She is on a few waiting lists for state housing, but that will probably be years before she makes it to the top of the list. Plus, those aren't really the greatest locations to raise a family. So, I'm stuck with trying to find a way to pay for an apartment for myself and continuing to pay for my house for her and the girls to live in. Unfortunately, we live way out in the country and there aren't many jobs available. So, I'm looking at moving pretty far away so that I can get a higher paying job to afford both. I'm really hating the idea of only getting to see my kids a couple of times a year though. I'm so torn on all of this that I can barely make any decisions. I could really use someone to talk to, to try and work through some of these decisions.

So to keep it short and sweet, I am nothing above average, pursuing a medical career, is that important, probably not. I met a girl in one of my classes, I began helping her with homework, found out she had a toxic relationship with a boyfriend, and i ultimately made her realize the relationship was no good for her. I offered a shoulder to cry on, eventually we developed a good friends relationship, ultimately we hooked up once or twice, nothing serious, just a little kissing and touching. All of this happening 3 or 4 months after the break-up After this, it seemed that she was distant and she admitted that she was uncomfortable, and needed a break. I'm not an asshole, i'm not going to force her to be uncomfortable. It led to her basically completely severing the relationship, and i've been trying to build it back up because it has been driving me crazy. I can't sleep, I can't regularly eat.

Alright so me [24/F] has been broken up with my ex [25/M] who I dated for only *3 months* is a little confused as to what to do. I broke up with him because it just wasn't working out. No hard feelings, he didn't do anything to me. I didn't do anything to him. Hes a very sweet nice guy. I just wasn't into it, I let him down as gently as could be. He also doesn't speak my first language, so our communication was a bit tedious. But he still calls me crying! Literally. Hysterical. He must text me every month at least twice (and I do not respond at all to any of his messages) and tonight which has marked 8 months being broken up he called me hysterical crying. I think he may have been drinking but im not sure. Had I known the number (I haven't looked at his in so long so I didn't know it was him) I wouldn't have answered. Now he says he wants to die, hes crying, hes crazy upset... I don't know what to say. I stay as long as I can on the phone to calm him, but he is just.. hysterical. I don't know what to do.

We have dated for 5 years, and she's lived with me for 2 years now. When we were long distance, she didn't seem to worry about anything. But now we live together, and if we go out to eat.. She's drives herself crazy looking around at a girl she thinks I might find attractive. And first off, I have never cheated on any girlfriend I've ever had. I'm not that kind of guy, and I tell her all the time. I'm her first boyfriend though, so I guess she can't help it. I need to know what to do though. She cries and cries telling me she's afraid I'll like someone more, cheat, leave her ect. And I am honestly so patient with her and have been for these two years with this. I try to calm her down, and ease the anxiety and it works for a few days.. But then it's back again. She's afraid to get old, because she said she'll be ugly and I won't be attracted to her anymore, and I'll leave for somebody who is younger. I'm asking this on here now, because we planned on going to a movie in the park this weekend.. And she's scared. She thinks there will be pretty young girls that I'll be attracted to. I told her I pay no attention to other girls. I only want her and love her like crazy. Then it ended up in a fight. Can anyone please help me help my girlfriend? I am a faithful guy and would never hurt her. How do I make her realize this for good?

Every time I tried to make plans with him, he'd talk about how busy he was with school and what not and then he'd get back to me later in the week -- which, of course, he never did. Then, I decided to try one more time (actually because my plans fell through with a different guy) only for him to tell me he was seeing someone. Fair enough. We didn't owe each other anything. So, I deleted his number and moved on. [Our lovely text conversation]( I'm 90 percent sure I handled this in the best way possible (other than not responding to him at all). I did genuinely like him but I'm not anyone's second choice nor am I a rebound. However, there's this part of me that wonders if I should give him a second chance -- despite his initial crappiness towards me. I guess I still want more of an explanation for his behavior. Why went so wrong between us? But he's just a kid, it's not likely he's had some mind-blowing epiphany about how to treat women better. I guess, I just want some reassurance I made the right choice myself.

So we have been dating for 6.5 years and living together for 5 years. We've talked about marriage off and on and he usually says something like ""I just want to be sure"" or ""I THINK I want to get married - I don't know"" etc. I used to really want to marry him but part of me is so resentful and hurt from seeing everyone else get married except me that I'm bitter. We used to have a great relationship but he is very passive aggressive, angry all the time and never in a good mood. He starts the day pissed off and ends it pissed off. I can't be a positive person around him. I tell him he has to be more positive and he changes for a few days or a week and then it's back to pissed. I'm pretty sure that I am wasting my time with him but I keep thinking it will get better and I don't want to miss him. I want to be in love and want someone to show me that they love me but now I'm convinced that true love is a bullshit lie. I don't know what to do anymore. It's crushing my spirit.

I met someone at my university that I get along with extremely well. He wants me to be his girlfriend. Based on his personality, morals, hobbies, I can see this person as a very good potential long-term partner for me. However, he is at least 70 pounds overweight. I like the features underneath (that sounds mean) and I can see past the weight if it is a temporary thing, but I dont want to be with an overweight partner eternally. I feel shallow............. He told me he's been more athletic than usual lately, doing sports and everything, in the effort to lose weight. But I know that's no guarantee. What should I do? I always hear over and over again to not date someone with the intention to change them. Should I date him if I'm not happy with his current physical state?

update: had my roommate read over this, he thought I was a bit too easy on myself. I **bolded** certain details he wanted me to add to give a fuller picture. A female roommate moved in with me into my apartment about a month ago, I think might have had a thing for me at one point. We share the same room with a couple, so it's 4 of us. At first she was really cheerful and seemed cool. **A few days in, I had weed for the first time and accidentally overdid it, I was way too stoned and and my roommates all claim they were worried at how stoned I was because I was zoning out.** She had invited me to cook with her and I agreed, but the next day I wasn't feeling well from the weed, told her I wasn't going to do it. We ended up having an argument about my flaking, and she used the ""you promised"" line on me. Now, I take promises very seriously, in fact I never promise anything unless it's already been fulfilled and the other person doesn't know yet. I called her out on it and told her that I never promised her anything, that she was lying. Big mistake. Immediately after this, she put up the biggest emotional wall I've ever seen. It's been 2 weeks and she skulks around all day, is as un-responsive as possible about anything, deadpan voice, one-word answers, no eye contact, turns away, frequent sighing. She hangs out with friends and has gone out with at least 1 other guy that I know of, I took a 10 day trip which I thought would give her some time to cool off, but after I returned she's the same. **She's also nice to the other roommates, so it's definitely just me.** There seems to be so much negative energy that I constantly feel like just leaving the house to not be around her. Not sure whether to ""have a talk"" or to give her more time and test the waters again later.

Background: He and I started dating mid-October. We've known each other for just about a year now. We met in a research lab at the school we go to. He's pretty extroverted, but guarded with his personal life, not in a defensive way...but in a doesn't talk much about it kind of way. I'm thinking this might be because he doesn't want me to judge him since he and I are from pretty different backgrounds. Growing up, my family was pretty well off. They live in a nice part of town. My parents are still married. Both of my parents are college graduates, as is my older brother. He lives in a rougher part of town. His parents aren't together anymore. I don't like poking much, but he's subtly implied that his father is dead. He's the first person in his family to go to college and his two younger sisters have followed his path. I'm incredibly proud of him. His mom is an alcoholic. I had a feeling she was based upon the bits and pieces that he would say. When I saw their house, it was obvious (filthy, cluttered, didn't seem to make any sense). Apparently she's started drinking again heavily...to the point where she blew out the front tires on her car trying to buy more alcohol yesterday and has no recollection of what happened. He told me he was taking the battery out of her car to make sure it didn't happen again. He's saving up right now to move out with one of his sisters, but until then he's stuck. My issue is this: How am I supposed to respond to him when he tells me about these things? What can I do to be supportive without overstepping any personal boundaries? I never grew up around anything like this and can't really relate. I feel awful for him though given his incredibly shitty circumstances. I guess I just want to be there for him in whatever ways I can without making him feel pitied or embarrassed.

Alright so a few weeks ago I tagged along with my sister in law [25 F] (yes I know she isn't technically my sister in law yet) to go to a dinner party and met one of her best friends. Nothing happened that night but we talked a lot and exchanged details. For the past couple of weeks I've been overseas so nothing physical could actually happen. Of course this doesn't mean I couldn't message her and this contact remained constant. On Saturday night, she came over for a few drinks before my sister in law and her were due to go get some dinner together, but in the end we all ended up drinking and having some dinner at home. Drinks started flowing and it didn't take long for us to all be tipsy. I guess you can probably see where this is going, eventually the night wound down and she decided to crash at our house and just head home in the morning. Once my brother and his girlfriend went to bed, she snuck into my room and.. It happened. Afterwards we kissed, agreed to silence for now and she snuck back into her own room. She left in the morning before I was up, and last night we all went around to her place for a barbecue. We kind of looked at each other like naughty teenagers, which is weird but given the circumstances was understandable. The dilemma now though, is that it appears a second date or few may be on the cards, and I'm unsure as to how to best approach this with my sister in law in particular. * Should I tell them about Saturday night? * If not now and it goes further, when should I tell them? * There's nothing wrong with this, right? * Is it okay if I keep seeing her in the mean time before anything is formally announced? If anyone could weigh in on this it'd be greatly appreciated.

Before we got married, my mom totally overwhelmed and bombarded my wife during the wedding process. My wife didn't want anything big but my family insisted(forced) on a jewish wedding with at least 100 people. They steamrolled us at every turn. Now, we are in debt because of the time we couldn't work before the wedding. My wife is deathly afraid of debt because her student loans are crazy (over 150k), and her parents are horrrrrible with money. Now we are four months into our marriage and she is depressed.

I'm 28. I've been friends with a girl for about 4 years and she's always seen me as a dick and smooth talker, and has always hated me for it...a few months ago we had a random weird hangout with just us and I opened up a little bit and got a little bit vulnerable and now she's always telling me that she wants me to be 'real' around her like I was that night. I have a pretty long history of playing women, being smooth, compliments off the top of my head, etc. I also have a history of being a general asshole to people. But when her and I started talking serious I began to let my emotions and vulnerabilities show a bit and she fell for those. However, I am really not sure how to be 'real' around her (or anyone else) because I've been acting like such a dick for so long to get women into bed with me and also to protect myself from getting hurt. I've decided I want to learn to be 'real' and be who I really am, but am not sure how to go about being that person. Can anyone give me some tips on how to be more open and real, and be less fake and 'acting' like I've grown accustomed to? She knows I love her, and she has very strong feelings for me, however she has told me she's extremely cautious because she's falling for the 'real' me, but because I'm always being smooth with her out of habit she's afraid that 'real' side isn't going to be there as much. I feel really stupid looking for advice on how to be 'real' but I just don't know what to do, I WANT to be real, but I'm not sure how to get back to who I really am inside.

Hi r/relationships, I'm in an unusual circumstance here. My boyfriend, Justin, and I have been in a wonderful relationship for 3 years. Justin has acne and scars covering his arms, face, back and chest, which doesn't bother me so much. He's a really handsome guy and I love him for who he is. What does bother me is the fact that in all the years I've known him, he has incessantly picked at his acne to the point where it's become worse and worse. The his skin gets angry and inflamed, and the acne never has a chance to heal. Now, I have relatively clear skin, but I understand the urge to pick annoying blemishes when they pop up. I'm guilty of this, and I think everyone is. However, Justin will pick his skin for a good hour. Sometimes when we're watching a movie or show, I'll look over and he's absentmindedly squeezing zits on his arm. Sometimes he doesn't even realize he's doing it until I point it out. It's that engrained in him. Another thing: Justin is also a very anxious person, to the point where (in my non- professional opinion) I believe it is driving him to pick at his skin. So reddit, here's my question. I KNOW Justin is self-conscious about his acne, but I also know the picking is not healthy. I honestly think he should see a therapist regarding his anxiety and picking. He's never seen one, and has been resistant to the idea when I bring it up. How can I get through to him? I obviously can't force him to see anyone, but how can I get him to see that the anxiety/picking is a big deal, and how our relationship might suffer because of it (it can be a turn-off)? When I brought the topic up in the past, he seemed to think the picking was no big deal and was dismissive. I love him dearly and am really worried about his mental and physical health.

As the title states, I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 8 months, and everything has been wonderful. Ever so recently, I met her conservative, Christian parents, who at the time being, knew nothing about my faith. Well, they are fond of stalking their daughter on social media, and since they know of our relationship, that attention has been directed right at me. Now, since it's Ramadan, Ive been posting Islam-related content on twitter, and of course, they saw the tweets. My girlfriend knows of my faith and has no issue, though her parents apparently do. For a week she replied to not a single text or snapchat, and just yesterday ""she"" sent me a text, claiming that we should go our own ways. I know for a fact this is because of her right-winged parents, and I'm awfully pissed that they care more about my belief than the actual person I am. What should I do? I love my girlfriend and everything has been fine, yet how can we overcome this barrier in our relationship? Love, prince

The relationship doesn't work, neither of us are happy (no physical contact, fight every day, a lot of unhappiness). I am losing motivation to do anything everyday, I just want out at this stage. I want her to be happy and I want to be happy. We have a 2 year old son who I love very much, I don't want him growing up learning that our relationship is what to expect.

hi r/relationships, I need some major help: [background] I met Shane my junior year of high school at mutual friends birthday party. We hit it off really well, and we continued to date for a year and a half (from junior year of high school to beginning of freshman year of college). Things were really great for the first year and two months.. but then shit sorta hit the fan. I got into serious car accident going into my freshman year of college, when I tried to contact Shane, he did not answer. That summer I did not hear from him at all, for a total of three months no contact. The thing is, in the summer he works on an island where he has no cell phone service. During this time, I basically broke down from not hearing from him and I put my parents through hell more or less. Fast forward to the start of the school year and we decided to break up. We remained broken up for a year. However, back in August, we rekindled the spark, really sat down and talked through the issues we had. We have started dating again much to my parents dismay. My dad literally will shut down if I mention Shane, refuses to talk to me, and refuses to talk to him. My mother on the other hand, is passive aggressive about everything he does. I've had to start to lie to them about everything I do just so I can spend time with him.I just want them to recognize that he has changed and grown up and dealt with the issues that we had. I can really see a future with this kid and I want my parents to be able to handle him as he is a part of my life.

So while I was at my boyfriend's house yesterday (we've been together for close to 10 months now), he asked me to get onto his laptop to change a song. A bunch of things were open, and I clicked on the page behind the spotify screen, thinking it was the browser screen. It was an ebook he had been reading. It seemed like it was talking a lot about sex, so I asked him what book it was a little while later. He said it was called ""The ethical slut"" and that his roommate recommended it to him, but he ""didn't like it that much"" (although he was on chapter seventeen). I let it go, not really knowing what the book was about, but out of curiosity I looked it up on Amazon today. It's about polyamory and open relationships. Now, at this point, I'm feeling a little uncomfortable with him reading a book about open relationships, which I am not interested in pursuing. It has me thinking, is this something he's interested in? Now, I'd like to bring it up to him later tonight when we talk on the phone, but I don't want to sound too accusatory or start anything unnecessary, but I need to know if this is something he's interested in or if he's just reading it because someone told him to. I'm just not sure how to bring it up in a stress-free, non-argumentative way (despite my negative feelings on the subject)?

Dear /r/relationships, My girfriend just (Friday night) broke up with me. I had called her to talk, as we do often now that I'm in college and half an hour's drive away from where she lives (I don't have a car). As we were talking, I mentioned that I'd be happy to see her next weekend (she had indicated she would come visit), as she had cancelled for last weekend (my birthday, but the timing was kind of late for her to be out normally anyways, so I didn't notice anything wrong there). Which is when she dropped it. Since then I've been pretty depressed. She's indicated that there's nothing I can do about it, but that it wasn't anything I did or didn't do. I personally find that hard to believe, and am inclined to think it's the strain of a long-distance (ish) relationship, and that if I had seen her last week this could have been avoided. What do you think? Is there any chance that if I ask her on a really nice date that this might fix things?

Hi, redirect me if I'm in the wrong subreddit unless someone can help... Also typo in the title. It's supposed to be with our child I'm 20 and my boyfriend is 22 we have a month old child together. The other day we got into a big argument which resulted in me leaving and going to my mothers house with our baby and leaving him at our house. While I was getting her in the carrier for the car he tried to barricade the door and wouldn't let me by. Our argument didn't happen in front of our child she was upstairs in the bedroom sleeping. But when I was walking out he threatened me that if I left him and took the baby he would take me to court for custody. I'm very shocked he would say that to me, he was never abusive and never said anything of that nature to me before. I'm tired of his bullshit and want out of the relationship because it's not even healthy anymore and after the other night it's gotten worse.

Hey guys & girls, So I've been seeing this girl for a few months. She's the same age as I am if that makes a difference. Things were going great. We were really clicking for a while and I really like her. She seemed to like me a lot back. We were 2 attractive young people certainly heading for a relationship I thought. But now, it seems like that's just a maybe. Recently she's been real busy with her new job she just started a month ago. She's been busy a lot, and hasn't had much time to see me. I work too, but my hours are better (one of the best things about what I do is the hours). Seeing as I like her a lot, it's a bit disappointing but I try to respect her space and I'm a very patient guy by nature. I think if we had been going out for a long time prior, I think this may be a different situation. But the lack of being able to see each other seems to have halted the progression of our relationship. Do you have any advice on how I should try to progress our relationship given the fact I only am seeing her every now and again? I like her more than any other girl I've dated, so I figured I'd ask if anything could help. Thanks friends!

Sorry in advance for the book, I guess I'm just trying to get it out. Whatever was left of my toxic relationship just came crashing down Friday night, the man I loved wasn't there, it was a man that called me a bitch, cussed at me, and threatens call the cops on me because I stood in front of the door and asked him to reconsider leaving and driving on the highway at 1230 am while he was sleep deprived, I let him go, I obviously wasn't going to hold him against his will, but he was accusing me of it, after he called me a bitch he said ""yeah go ahead and look at me like I'm abusive, go ahead."" As he left, I tried to give him a hug, he basically gave me a cold shouldered hug so I rejected it and he said ""go ahead and play the victim real fucking cool."" And stormed out. I reached out to him yesterday, he said he wasn't comfortable being around me, he's treating me like I'm abusive. I know I'm not perfect but I didn't do anything completely crazy to incite such a reaction, i just wanted to love him, and for him to love me. I have lost myself in this relationship, I don't have hardly any friends in my city (only a couple that are in serious relationships), and I feel so empty, and I still feel like part of it was my fault, should I have been more ""easy going"" and ""cool"" and go with the flow... I know I'm being irrational and I should be glad he's gone, I guess I'm just hurting and having a hard time distinguishing between heathy and unhealthy conflicts. Has anyone ever felt so crushed even though the relationship wasn't healthy? Does it get better?

I've been married for about a year, and was dating my wife for the 3 years prior to that. For full disclosure, I'm madly in love with my wife, but would be lying if I didn't admit that her sister is a looker. My SIL is not a terrible person, but we're not super close either. She can be pretty mean to her family at times, and we all have to work at getting along with her. This year over the holidays my sister in law was visiting, and the three of us smoked a bit of pot together (not something we ordinarily do). I thought taking part in some pot would put us all at ease. When we were smoking, I think that I was kind of leering over at her or something. I remember feeling awkward at the time, but thought I had kept it to myself. Apparently not. Over facebook chat (who facebook chats?!), my SIL just initiated an awkward conversation with me where she wanted to confirm that she could just be friends with me, because that's what she liked about married men. She said she liked how there were no ambiguities in her friendships with married men, and that was why she got along with them so well. She asked to confirm that was our relationship over the course of the conversation, repeatedly. My question for you, /r/relationships: 1) What can I do to not leer at her like this? It's quite unseemly, and not who I think of myself as. 2) Do I owe my wife an apology, or should I never ever ever bring this up (leaning towards the latter, I suspect this would not be a fun conversation for her)? 3) Any other nuggets of unsolicited wisdom? I know /r/relationships is great for those :)

My SO and I have been 'dating' about three years. He has two best friends, a lesbian couple, that he is good friends with that I have only ever meet one time for about 3 minutes. These girls do not live together and one of them he spends a lot of time with. Apparently without my knowledge for the first two years we were dating they were doing scheduled activities about three times a week together. Since then I have expressed that I think he should be letting me know when he is hanging out with a girl at her house by himself. He has since been great about telling me 'hey I'm going over to so-and-so's house' but… It really bothers me.

A bit of backstory: Me and my bf have been together for 11 months. A couple ago I found very flirty texts between my bf & another girl (I'd been suspicious for a while since there were certain times he would angle his phone away from me, or would only answer it after I'd left the room). He always initiated the flirting with her. I confronted him and he promised it wouldn't happen again and let me look at his phone any time I wanted after that. I only took advantage of that twice because I want to learn to trust him. There was also another girl who was obviously trying to get with him but he wasn't very responsive at all. He brushed her off. It seemed like he was totally uninterested. But whenever he likes her new profile pic it shows up on my feed so maybe I was wrong. She's also invited. I woke up this morning and he sent out invites on facebook. My heart dropped because he invited both of these girls and I don't know how to feel. I feel dumb for being hurt - it is his birthday, after all, and they've all been friends longer than I've known him. But it's compounded by the fact that we haven't had sex in 2 months. He's very stressed (debt, bills) and is worried that I'm going to have a panic attack during sex (because of my PTSD) so part of it is my fault. But I'm scared theres something more to it. And I don't know how to talk to these girls. I'm not going to be a jerk to them, I'm a very nice person. But it hurts a lot still no matter how stupid it may seem. I want to talk to him about it but its not that I don't want them there, its that I want him to be honest with me in whether he's still flirting with them or not. I don't feel like his girlfriend. I feel like his snuggle buddy who lives with him. He's already stressed enough I don't need to add to it. I'm very confused.

so i have this friend which i met a couple of months ago. She goes to my school and she is a year older(she is 18 and im 16). We met on an exchange trip, i have never seen her before till then.During the trip we made friends. Once the trip ended we kept talking pretty much every day ( we have been talking for about 2 months and half), i asked her if she would like to go to a cafe with me and she said yes, 2 weeks later i invited her to the cinema and she also said yes. But in this second ""date"" there were a lot of silents moments since we are kind of shy and talking is definitely not my best strenght so i thought i fucked it pretty hard. However, we kept talking everyday. I tend to overthink things and when it comes to love even more, im not the sexyiest man on earth and i dont really understand why she even accepted to date with me. I dont think anyone would accept 2 dates with one person if he is not interested in the other one but on the other side, im the one that always starts the conversations and she never does. When i talk to her she answers me just fine and she keeps the conversation pretty well but she never searches me, not even once. What should i do?, i was thinking to do an ""all-in"" and ask her to be my gf but im not really confident, pleeeeaaase help. I also feel a lot of pressure since my friends tell me that i should have already kissed her.I would also like some topics to chat with her since im not that good with that. Sorry for the bad english its not my main language.

Met a girl in Uni and stayed together for 5 years, she was the girl I lost my virginity to and she had one partner before me so we were both pretty inexperienced. I didnt know it then but I suffer from anxiety issues and had several ""performance related issues"" shall we say...fuck it its a throwawy, sometimes I couldnt get it up and often I would launch the business too soon, leading to massive self esteem issues and feelings of inferiority. That relationshp ended and i was a mess. My fear is now, how am I going to get passed the awkward new bit of a relationship especially the sexual part without a girl thinking im a freak? I think Im a good guy, I care too much, im not one for shagging around, I know im young but I really like being in relationships, I love the security and comfort and genuine love that it comes from, waking up next to someone and lying around in each others arms deciding what to do for the day that kind of thing. I dont really have a question as such, maybe im just looking for input/advice, but I dont feel like Im a great catch, I feel like meeting someone I would be overcome with nerves that I would excuse myself from stuff until she got fed up of me, or dissapoint her so much in the bedroom that she'll find somone who couldnt count their sexual partners with 1 finger. I think in some ways I could be attractive considering im reasonably fit, do some interesting hobbies and have lots of interests and stuff which may attract people but then theyll see my insecurities and decide that theyd rather a boyfriend than a project and go somewhere else!

So I got a new job around a month and a half ago and I started to like one of my co-workers. She's super funny, nice and full of energy all of the time, but my problem is that I have no idea if she's just trying to be friendly with the new guy or if she's actually flirting with me. Within two weeks of working there she invited me to a bonfire she's having with a ton of other people there, which kind of sent me mixed messages because on one hand she barely knows me and is inviting me to a party, but on the other hand she's basically invited almost everyone she knows. Then a bit later she started to swap breaks with other people we work with so she could be on break with me, but that's kind of died down now. We have exchanged numbers because when she asked me if I had plans on the day of the party I said I didn't, but that I would need a reminder closer to the date because I'm really forgetful. So she said if I gave her my number she could just text me a reminder. We didn't text at all after that, but a couple of weeks ago I texted her to see if she had won her school election (I was waiting for an excuse to text her so it wouldn't be as awkward). We talked for a bit, but it stopped when I had to go. I texted her again, using another excuse, and we talked for a bit until I was too tired to. Now I'm lost because I don't have any experience with this and I'm horrible at texting people without it ending in an awkward silence. Please give advice on what I should do next.

So, I have a friend's with benefits. We haven't gone all the way because he is a virgin and I am not, and I respect that and don't want to push him to lose it if he doesn't. We cuddle, kiss, make out, and have fooled around. In fact, he was the one to initiate all of it. I am the first girl he's been able to do these things to, and although there was a time when we thought we'd be an item, it never happened upon mutual agreement. He loves to cuddle and innocently sleep with me. Nothing wrong with that, however lately he's been rejecting a lot of the fooling around. Even things such as kissing my neck or touching my breast. We do belong to a religion that looks down on premarital sex etc., so I'm sure that's a factor, but it hurts because he isn't consistent. Some days he'll be okay with it, and other days he's holding back, leaving me hanging, and honestly hurt and insecure. I feel as if I'm not good enough or I'm unattractive (which I know I'm not). He jokingly calls me a temptress, and a few days ago I asked if he honestly wanted to stop all of the fooling around because he didn't want to do anything more than cuddle. All he said was, ""maybe..."" and I told him that's not a straight answer. His response was he didn't know. I'm just so confused by his actions, and honestly I'm also hurt. It makes me feel so insecure and I really don't know what to do anymore.

Hello redditers. I'm turning 35 in a few weeks and this is my first birthday as a single man in many years. I must say it is quite scary and unnerving for me because every year on my bday I usually wake up w a s.o. next to me and wishing me a happy birthday. So this is my first one that I will wake up alone and my son in the other room. I do know and I realize the fact that I broke up and ended the relationship for a good reason and it just was not healthy for me mentally and as well as physically. However I will have at least 10 friends who will celebrate my birthday with me at my favourite watering hole. So that part I am really looking forward to it :).

So my parents are from India. They don't understand me wanting independence. For example, I'm driving up to New Jersey for my friend's wedding. My Mother begin insisting that she drive up with me to visit New York. I wouldn't have minded if she was just visiting New York, but I feel more like she wanted to come to keep an eye on me. When I said no, she turned it into a why do you never want to spend time with your parents. Etc, etc, more guilt tripping. Her constant calling on me to check up where I am, her constant wanting me to tell her every detail on my life and overall treating me like a five year old is driving me insane. I told her I was going to go to Italy this fall and my Mom said ""No."" I WHAT AUGH. I don't know how to make my parents understand that we do not live in India and I am not going to be a obedient little Indian child that listens to what they tell me to do till I get married. I don't know how to not hurt their feelings or make them understand though. They literally don't understand. They don't understand the concept of me not listening to them. They see it as me abandoning them and abandoning the family.

Maybe this would be a better question for health specialists, but I'm having trouble contacting my doctor and need some insight on how this could happen, and maybe some advice from people that have encountered a similar situation. Backstory: I was leaving for a month-long trip to Eastern Europe and I visited with my girlfriend right before leaving (long-distance relationship). Everything went well, I love seeing her and her family. I leave to Europe and about a week later I get a very long and strongly worded Facebook message that she tested positive for chlamydia. She said it hurt to pee after we had sex and so she went and got tested. We have unprotected sex and have been dating for over a year so I figure I MUST have it too. I did some reading and apparently chlamydia can go untreated for long periods of time, so I thought that maybe one of us caught it before we started dating and didn't exhibit symptoms until now. Stupid I know, but I'm not a doctor. The trip goes by and I return home and immediately go to the health clinic. I tell my doctor what happened and she says that it would be best to do an all around STD test to make sure it's only chlamydia. She also gives me the Z-Pak meds and I go on my merry way, thinking that this is behind us. Well, as it turns out, I tested negative for everything, including fucking chlamydia. How is this possible? Maybe she contracted it from another guy after I left then tried to pin it on me? Why would she even tell me in the first place, if that was the case? I'm confused. Any advice is welcomed.

I don't have the heart to break it to my parents that I can't have an eighteenth birthday party, or do anything for my eighteenth birthday party, because I have no friends. My 18th birthday is coming up in August, and I'm very worried and scared and embarrassed about it. I just know it's going to be terrible, and I'm going to fill like utter shit throughout it. I don't have any friends at all, and it a fucking kills me; I have no meaningful attachments with anyone my age, no genuine friendships, I am worthless to everyone and am genuinely suffering a sort of crippling loneliness. Scrolling through social media like Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat is very painful, seeing how popular and likeable people are and seeing them do amazing and fun things with their friends...and it both devastates me and makes me insanely jealous. Seeing people go to parties, have fun, go on road trips, go on holidays, just hang out...I've never experienced anything like that. Hell, the last time I remotely did anything with another person was a year ago. Every day I spend in my house, on the Internet...and that's it. My twin sister has been going on recently about how excited she is for our birthday and how she's got all these amazing plans with her friends. It kills me inside. She has a really large friendship group and she goes out every night and there's me like a fucking loser at home, again, watching TV or something until I just fall asleep. So I have absolutely no one to invite to an eighteenth birthday party, but my parents keep insisting that I should do something and invite ""my friends"". I don't have the heart to tell them their son is a worthless, unlikeable, unsocialble friendless person. Any advice?

I know she still has their old texts. But she says she hates him a lot, for what he put her through. And I can totally see that. It just seems like she's not over him.

He's my roommate/friend who I've known for a few years since we're in the same major at my college. After living with him for the past 6 months though, we're good friends, although I didn't even start to think of him romantically until a month or two in when a good majority of our mutual friends commented that we'd be perfect and ""definitely will be a thing."" Just sayin - I'd have to agree with the being perfect thing because we get along fantastically. But he's a senior right now; he's very motivated and focused on the future, along with the fact that - according to our third roommate (who's the guy in question's best friend) - the guy I like has literally no clue how to handle girls AT ALL. As in everything that ever happened to him with a girl happened because the girl initiated something and usuallllllyyyy ended badly since he had no clue how to deal with chicks. Several mutual friends that are some of his best friends have offered to talk to him and bring me up because they think he probably likes me too, and that they can get him to do something about it. I don't like the idea, but at this point I'm scared as fuck because I have no clue how to handle guys in a serious way. Even thinking of how to start that conversation just doesn't compile - this is the first guy I've thought about seriously in over two years!! That's like 1/10 of my entire life.

Anyways, a few days ago, I ended up hitting a pothole and fucking up my muffler/tailpipe real bad. Yesterday, I finally was able to get it fixed, but the city refused to pay for it. I sent her a message saying ""Lol, my car is finally fixed but the city won't pay for it 😞 They said it was my fault, despite it being hidden as fuck."" I sent them as 2 separate messages though. Was I being desperate? Was I being negative? It's been 24 hours and no response. I'm trying to figure out what I said wrong? Can someone help me? My social anxiety is through the roof.

""i'm in love with you, you're my best friend, I made a mistake"" all the usual... She just says she is scared of meeting someone else when she is in a committed relationship. What does that mean?

So for starters, this is a stranger situation, at least for me. I met this woman a few weeks ago, and we hung out on Saturday. She went down to the comedy club she didn't know I was performing at, and we just ran into each other. We had a few drinks and kept talking for the rest of the night. Had a super great time. Afterwards, I walked her home and in our combined drunken state, we awkwardly stood at her front step, seemingly waiting for someone to make a move. I did, but ended up only giving the forehead kiss. I felt like a moron and my Uber driver played a little therapist that night. Cut to: next day. I text her, testing the waters to see if everything was cool, and it turns out she thought it was incredibly sweet. So my confidence, with a quick 180 decided that I was going to ask her out. I did yesterday, and we are going to a coffee shop today. Now is where my questions comes in. 1. Do I still treat this like a first date? 2. Should I completely avoid the kiss this time? 3. Am I on the right track here?

Hello relationships. I (21m) just had my gf (21f) of 2.5 years break up with me. We were very serious and had even talked about getting married. About a week and a half ago her stepmother died. She has spent the entire last week with her now widowed dad. Now the day before she comes back she breaks up over the phone. She tells me she wants someone who actually enjoys spending time with her family. I have been resistant in the past to spend weekends at her house, I favor just spending weekends with her(I still like her family though). She says her decision is final, but we actually had an amazing relationship and idk if she made the decision out of grief. I don't know if I just accept my fate, but I don't want to, I think we can still be together. I think this isn't an insurmountable issue, but she is stubborn. And gets more stubborn if you try to argue with her. I don't know what to do. Additionally I have struggled with depression in my life and I don't really have a friend base outside of my girlfriend. I am very very lost right now.

Hi, There is a girl[20] that I like a lot. We know each other for about 6 months (more or less). Recently I started hitting on her. You know, writing texts asking what's going on and stuff. We get a long anyway. Last weekend we met at the university, talked to her, teased a little bit, was cool. Tried to ask her out, she refused - she was smiling every time we spoke - so I told her I'll text her later in the week and ask her out then. After that on her face appeared cutest smile I've ever seen. Of course she said she'll refuse. Waited 3 days - as one of my friends told me to do. Texted her last night, asked out and well. That's where things are getting complicated. At first she was thinking about it, then she wasn't sure, told her I'll text her tomorrow (which is today) and till then she can decide whether to go or not. After a while she texted back, asking me, that was quite ""odd"" question. Why do I want to go out with her? Texted back I like her, she shouldn't be affraid (she never had a boyfriend, and I never had a girlfriend) it's something new to me, we can just go out eat pizza for instance, chat a little bit and see how things are going. If we won't get a long, it's fine I won't bother her anymore. So now, I'm here because I'm totally confused. Do you think I should give up or what? I'm really, really confused and need some help.

I worked for a company all through school so last year they were ok with me taking the year off to travel before settling down. I just got back this week and it's mostly the same people on my team with a few new people. Tuesday we had a team meeting where I was welcomed back and I introduced myself to the new people. Unfortunately for me one of the people who I thought was new was someone I worked with for 3 years before leaving and I guess she decided to start wearing a hijab in the time I was gone. So I introduced myself and she said ""no its me, (name), do you not remember me?"" and it took me a long time because she looks completely different with a hijab on and I still wasn't convinced she was the same person. When I did clue in I said something like ""oh wow you look completely different with the hijab"" like a fucking idiot and everyone in the room turned and gave me a death stare like they were horrified I would point it out. Anyways I tried to just carry on with the meeting but when I would talk the old ladies I worked with would just raise their eyebrows and look away. Asked my friend about it later to find out if anything weird happened that would garner such a reaction but there's nothing. I apologized to the girl and she was still upset so I tried to just drop it. Yesterday I went to talk to some of the people on my team for help with something and one woman cut me off to tell me I was a sexist asshole for not recognizing her and said she wears the hijab because of people like me and the other women were nodding in agreement. Everyone's treating me like shit now and these women used to really like me. So is what I said sexist? I really didn't recognize her with the hijab, I didn't think there was anything sexist about that but everyone else seems to think so. If I was wrong, how should I go about thinking this? Defending myself and saying I'm not sexist hasn't been working too well for me.

I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about 1.5 years. She's my second serious girlfriend while I'm only her first. We've generally been happy over the time that we've been together, but we've hit a rough patch over the last three or four months because we've both been busy with school and so we haven't been able to see each other that much (we live about an hour's drive from each other). From the beginning of our relationship, she was always very concerned with what I'd done with my ex, how far we'd gone and other things like that. I always tried to avoid answering those questions because I felt that it would've done more harm than good for her to know, since she gets upset easily and I knew it would affect her a lot. One of the questions she asked me was if we ever exchanged any naughty pictures - I told her no, partly because I wanted to protect her feelings and partly because I didn't think it was necessary to tell her. Fast forward to today. I left my Dropbox account logged in on her computer, and she went through all my photos - including a dirty one from my ex. She flipped out on me and said I abused and violated her trust, and she wants a breakup. Before this gets into a debate over whether it's right or wrong to keep such photos, I'd just like to say that it isn't like I go back to the photo to jack off to every few days or anything. I haven't looked at it since we broke up about 2 years ago, and I completely forgot it was there cause the folder is really full. I've deleted it, but the damage has already been done. On my part, I know I fucked up by lying to her about the pictures. But my intention was to protect her feelings, not for any selfish purposes, and I feel that matters involving exes are private. Regardless, I've apologized and said that I'll make it up to her and slowly try to gain her trust back by being completely honest with her about everything in the future. She says she doesn't want to do it anymore, and we should just break up. What should I do?

Another party we were at, my GF and I want to go on the roof to check out the view, and Ashley decides to leave BF and friends inside, and come with us to the roof. Twice. Another time, we went on a party bus, and I was sitting w/ my GF, and Ashley sits down next to me (her BF is on other end of bus) at the beginning of the bus. I felt somewhat uncomfortable, thinking she should be with her BF, so tried to pretend I didn't notice. But when we took a group picture, she was again next to me resting her hands on me. Also a few weeks ago she randomly sends me this text at night saying ""I miss you."" Could all this have been instigated when she wore a skimpy bathing suit two summers ago, and we were sun tanning at her pool waiting for my GF to get home? Am I just over-reacting? Am I seeing something when there is nothing??

I know that even having a pros and cons list means it's over.. my mind knows I shouldn't want him back but my retarded heart won't listen! I have never felt passionate love towards him, but simply grew to love his sweetness and I miss it so much. **Pros:** Incredibly sweet Caring Loyal Puts my needs first Loves me Patient Warm voice Very sexy Generous Loves MILFs (higher chance of still finding me attractive when I'm older) Eager to please Occasional Raver (just like me) Hark-working **Cons:** No fiery passion Not very intelligent Not a deep thinker, we never have intellectual conversations Not completely honest (but who is?) Doesn't open up about his feelings Doesn't kiss (I love kissing) Premature ejaculator and doesn't try to fix it (insecure about it) Doesn't want commitment now because his job is unstable Doesn't show me that he finds me attractive, ever (although everyone else around him does) No interests/hobbies in common except raves which I may be getting too old for, and traveling. Anti-science and anti-equal-rights (I'm the opposite)

To make this short, I and the afore-mentioned friend met and befriended each other three years ago because we were in the same fandom. This past summer, I befriended someone else in the same fandom, who in turn introduced me to their friends so now my Skype and phone contact list has never been bigger. The problem is that my friend (let's call her Kira) is now constantly making passive-aggressive jabs on multiple platforms of social media (Twitter/Instagram/Facebook/Tumblr, etc.) at my newer circle of friends. Kira does not like these people, despite the fact that they've never interacted personally. She never once hinted to me that she hated them or may have had some sort of run-ins with them, and the new group of friends have told me that they actually *enjoyed* what commentary Kira had to say about issues in our fandom. They are stunned that someone they've never talked to hates them with a passion. I've reached my breaking point - she is going around making extremely aggressive jabs at a particular person in the group (but isn't naming them, surprise surprise). It's gone from a once/twice a week thing to twice/three times *every day*. My question now is, how can I confront Kira about her posts in a non-aggressive manner?

So the title is pretty much it. For those of you who don't know who Dan Bilzerian is, he is some super rich trust fund/poker guy who is always flying private jets around and spending millions of dollars and surrounded by naked women all the time. Always posting pictures with piles of cash and random naked hookers/models all over. I didn't know until last week, but I guess him and my bf have been friends for a few years. They met in Monaco and apparently have ""similar hobbies""(which worries me, because it seems like the guy's hobbies are coke and strippers and spending money) My boyfriend got invited to spend a few days in Vegas with him next week. I really don't want him to go. I'm worried he's going to be drunk and surrounded by naked women and lots of temptation. He says they're just going to be racing cars and playing poker and having a good time etc. But I doubt that's all they will be doing. I don't want to be the controlling gf telling my boyfriend who he can and can't be friends with, but the guy seems like a womanizing douche. I was kind of upset when my bf said they are friends with similar ""hobbies"". Is it wrong for me to tell him I don't want him to go? How can I tell him how I feel without seeming like I'm super controlling and don't trust him?

I just need an outside opinion on this. My boyfriend [22] and I [23] have been together for 4 years. Never had any trust issues before. A couple of days ago he got home a bit later than usual. I asked what he was up to and he told me he was at dinner with a friend. Okay, that's fine, doesn't bother me. Then he goes on to tell me his dinner was so expensive, and that he spent about $30. Out of curiosity I ask what place was so expensive that his meal alone was $30. ""Oh I paid for my (female) coworker."" So he went to dinner with his similarly aged female coworker and paid for her dinner. I was pissed off. It sounds like a date to me. Especially because I don't know this woman, I don't know if she is interested in him, and if she were, him paying for her dinner wouldn't send the right signals that he's not interested. It also pissed me off because I don't remember the last time he took me out. I bought him dinner when I got a bonus, I tend to do things like that. But I realize now that he won't pay for me unless he owes me money or something. He also makes about 20k more than me. Not to mention that while he's paying for this other woman I am home cleaning up his dogs piss. When I let him know that his dinner came off as a date and made me uncomfortable he couldn't comprehend why I was upset. He went so far as to mock me, telling me he was going to a friends party this weekend and he would probably chip in for her dinner, so I shouldn't cry. All I got from him was a ""sorry you feel uncomfortable about it"". Am I way off base here? Like I said, we have never had trust issues but this felt shady to me. I just need an outside opinion since ours seem to be so distant from each other.

Hi r/relationships, I wish I was coming for advice in a better situation Earlier today I spoke with my dad who informed me of the death of a classmate from elementary and junior high. He was apparently murdered a few months and I don't think the person responsible has been arrested yet. I'm not sure if the details and there isn't anything online besides an obituary. My dad heard about this from my classmates mom. She asked my dad if I would be willing to visit her at some point over Christmas break. Her son apparently had a crush on me throughout the years that we knew each other and she just wants to talk and reminisce. I'm planning on going and bringing any old pictures that I have. Is there anything else I should do or say that would bring her comfort? I haven't lost too many people close to me and I'm not sure of the best way to handle this.

We are in a relationship for more than a year, we were friends with benefits before for some months. Generally things are great. I love her and helped her get out of depression and progress in her life. I have never seen her so happy and calm since i met her. She is a really attractive girl and many guys try to go out with her, which is often a reason why we fight, because she tries to avoid them but never tells them to stay away from her, so they always come back. Some days ago she went on a short holiday on an island where her grandparents live. Today, while we were talking on the phone she told me that she will go for a walk and will call me back in half an hour. About 2 hours later she texted me and told me that she is sorry and that she found an old friend and went for a long walk or sthing. I asked her who that friend is. she replied that she and this guy had kissed before I met her. She said she is sorry she lied to me, but if she told me over the phone while we were talking I would be really angry and some other nonsense. She then told me that she texted him to meet up but she expected that she would be with her friends while they were meeting. Afterwards she said they just walked and that she was really bored. She didn't seem to think that i would mind much. I told her that I can't accept those kind of lies and that we have discussed these situations before, so I can't believe she behaved that way. I am sure she didn't cheat on me, which may sound stupid but let's leave it to that. I think I know her well enough to be able to understand if she is hiding something. Totally thinking about breaking up with her, still want to hear some other opinions until i am completely calm and make my decision.

She broke up with me two weeks ago. She still loves me, but was very hurt by some recent mistakes I've made and overall just wasn't happy with the way our relationship had been as of late. We have not seen each other or talked since, other than a few text messages. We haven't texted at all in the last week or so, but I have told her that I wanted to talk about things at some point. I've explained to her that I understood where she was coming from the way she felt. I have taken the time to evaluate our relationship, how it was, and if I truly want it to continue it and fix/improve it, and the answer is yes, there is no doubt. I'm not 100% sure if she wants to get back together but I'm also not sure that she doesn't. She responds to my texts and she hasn't said anything spiteful. She still has kept her facebook and twitter profile pictures of us togeter and has not changed her relationship status (not stalking, just something you notice). What would be the best course of action for me from here? What could I say to her that would mean the most and show her that I and this relationship can change for the better? Our would be 6 year anniversary is coming up on the 22nd. I know that day is going to tough for both of us. I'd like to talk to her in person before then, but I just don't when, or if it's been long enough. I feel like if I wait around too long, I'll lose my chance.

I(19M) met this girl(18 F) this semester in school. For some reason she told me she thought I was sweet when we got into a conversation in class. I thought she had a crush on me or something. Now I'm a rather introverted and somewhat pessimistic person. I don't like intiating conversations with people I don't really know unless they are interested in me and are really friendly. I just feel like I normally have nothing worth contributing in convo. The conversation me and the girl had didn't really flow outside of topics about the class but it wasn't a total failure. But another person butted into the conversation and stole her attention from me. For some reason I started having a major crush on hef despite not talking to her outside of class. I ended up buying her snacks just to her smile and hug me giving me a warm queasy feeling in my stomach. After about two months I wanted her to know that I liked her so I built up my courage and did a ring pop proposal. She happily accepted and we had a bit of playful ""husband and wife banter"", but nothing really changed, we still didn't talk outside of class mostly because I felt if she was interested she'd show me a sign coupled with the fact that I didn't really feel like I had anything that she'd be interested in listening to. In fact things started to get worse she stopped talking to me in class, and only even seems to acknowledge me when I say hi or give her snacks. I worked up the courage to tell her that I like her and asked for her number. She seemed surprised but gave me her number. I asked if she was just doing it to be nice and she said that she's a nice person and hugged me. So today I shot her text after school asking if she liked the new snack that I gave her. She replied that she did thanked me and stopped replying. I tried sending her two messages after, but yeah. I don't want to feel like a nag. I'm hoping she is just busy, but I'm pretty sure she doesn't like me :/. Should I even try calling her when she doesn't even seem interested in class or text? Please help

Hello everyone - first time caller, long time listener. At the end of the week I am going on a date with a friend-of-a-friend and I'd appreciate some tips on how to play this one to secure a more romantic second date (or ideally a relationship). * We've known each other for around a year, and usually meet in social situations. We have a similar sense of humour and get along well. * She has previously been messaging me for advice regarding another guy that she liked, but he recently let her down. After discussing whether there are any decent guys left in the world, she said that she'd like to do something fun with me instead. * I'm hoping to go somewhere fun and exciting for the date, rather than the typical coffee/dinner. I've read that increased heart rate can simulate passion - I'm willing to go with that! Any tips on behaviour/body language/speech I can use to tip the balance in my favour? Any non-verbal cues I should look out for from her? I'm generally rubbish with subtlety.

I've been dating my first girlfriend for 9 months. I'm gone for the summer doing an internship. She was planning on flying out to see me, but she's had some recent financial difficulty because she's not getting enough hours at her job(s). So we were talking and she basically said that in this case I should buy her ticket and fly her out. Financially, I don't think this would be a problem. Doing some back of the envelope calculations, I would have to work a full 8 hour day at my internship to pay for her to fly out and stay for 4 or 5 days. So the issue here is really just that I feel weird about this. Now, I feel like if the roles were reversed she would probably fly me out. But frankly the roles are so rarely reversed. I always have money, she usually doesn't. So with a few notable exceptions if we do anything it comes out of my pocket. So I partially feel like I'm being a cheap bastard, but I really just don't want to feel like Mr. Moneybags here. I want to feel like I'm a member in an equal partnership and not a benefactor. So I asked her to split it half way, but she can't even do that. Now on top of that we've been dating for 9 months and I think that we may break up after we graduate. We discussed that a bit recently as well. It's not as if either of us wants to, but we've at least discussed the possibility that we may each go our separate ways. So now that that's on the table, I feel weird going to great efforts in a relationship that is likely to end within the next year. Overall, this is the first time I've had to deal with this kind of thing and I'm just really confused. What would you do in my shoes?

I'm a 28 year old female, with my boyfriend for a little over 2 years. He's a great guy, I mean a really great guy. Personality-wise, we match in that we have the same beliefs, morals, taste in music, clothes, lifestyles, etc. Well we have made it through some tougher times, long-distance, etc and are still together. Issue #1- Sex is a chore. I only feel like this with him. I know from past relationships (ones that I have been in for two years) that I don't feel like this because I'm bored, as in the past that was not the case. He has a good sex drive, I just want it to be over with. I've browsed the sex advice subreddit, but I posted this here because I think it's more than that. Issue #2- Excitement is gone. Im bored as hell and have felt this way after 4-6 months of dating him. So my question is, Do all relationships end up feeling like you are living with your best friend/roommate? I honestly feel this way. I mean I love him I really do, but its like Im dating Mr. Friendzone. Shouldn't I know after 2 years if I want to marry him? Is the fact I'm questioning it proof that I don't? The only reason I think I would is because I know he'd be a good husband and great dad, but I'd be a numb woman just going through the motions.

So a little backstory. Me and my girlfriend met in high school we had an interest in each other but things went sour. Like really sour we didn't talk for two years. But then all of a sudden one night we are at a party and we start talking I ask her to show me the bathroom since she's been to the place before and she ends up kissing me when we are alone this starts this whole relationship which I can honestly say is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. So fast forwarding we are nine months in at the moment and we are on break. I have been unapreciative and controlling of her decisions to hangout with her guy friends due to how things ended two years ago and she was totally in the right for putting me in my place and not taking my shit anymore. However I feel like I have taken a good hard look at what I have done and am working on changing my behavior because I love her. But she is still not sure if she wants to go down the road of giving me a chance because she doesn't want me to hurt her again by going back to how I was before this happened. She doesn't believe I have changed and I don't know how to show her. I feel like the only way I can actually show it is if she gives me a chance and takes a leap of faith. I have slipped a few times and have overreacted to some things she says and she has called me on it and she has said that this is why she was leaning towards yes but now is not. She is taking a week to think about what she wants and I just don't know what I can do to assure her that I want to make these changes and continue our relationship.

My wife makes $14k / year as a server, I make $46k salary. In our 5 years of marriage she has racked up over $60k in debt from a combination of student loans and hospital bills. She's very good at being frugal, no CC debt or other loan debt. I encouraged her to pursue further education (as a teacher), but she failed out. We both want kids but we're too strapped with payments to afford them - as in adoption fees since she can't have kids naturally due to the ovarian cyst. I feel frustrated because she won't take a credit hit, and hospital bills continue to accrue. I pay for her insurance (her previous insurance was very bad). We've negotiated with the hospital to bring down the debt by 60% but there's still at least $20k to go. I find myself mad a lot more than I used, not at her because it's not her fault she keeps needing surgery. I'm mad at doctors, for not being able to figure out how to deal with a cyst that causes her a great deal of pain. She's a real sweetheart and I've had my frustration come out at her several times. I've told her I felt that she's not pulling her weight, and she broke down crying saying, ""what do you want me to do about it?"" I felt like such an asshole; what am I supposed to tell her - get a different job?

Backstory: When I got out of high school, I was dating a girl I cared about very deeply. It seemed everything was going well. We moved in together a year later and shared an apartment for about a year. At the end of that year, she cheated on me with a previous boyfriend and left. I won't deny that I could have done a few things better. The purpose of this topic is not to shame her. However, I am fairly sensitive to rejection and this, to use an academic term, absolutely wrecked my shit. I spent the next six months drinking heavily, but eventually moved to a new town and got my act together. I'm still single, but my general quality of life is much better. But, even though its been almost two years and I don't keep in contact with my ex anymore, sometimes I experience something I can only describe as ""emotional shellshock"". Suddenly, it's like reliving a condensed version of that whole experience. It's very draining and painful, and it almost feels like I lose control of my own thoughts. Sometimes it happens without warning, but most times it's a reaction to a conversation or a piece of media that contains infidelity. I understand that being in pain is part of the process, but...I can't help but feel that the process should already be over for me. I feel like this kind of long-term scarring is abnormal. I feel like I should be over this, that it shouldn't bother me. It feels like the fact that this still has the ability to damage me so intensely means that there's something wrong with me. Is that true?

I have tried posting this in r/bdsm ages ago and am going to try again, and i tried askreddit but got no helpful advice. GF; 18, me (m); 18 been together 8 months. She has been the victim of rape and sexual abuse and a lot of verbal abuse by family/ex bofriend. It has pretty evidently affected her self esteem and self worth overall. Recently she confided in me that she wants to engage in some dom/sub and light (pretty much mainstream) bondage. She really likes verbal degradation and being hit/slapped around, very rough sexytimes. I do not think this is a good idea, I think she wants this because its her comfort zone and she is so used to being treated that way in a sexual context, so i don't really agree to participate. This upsets her so i agree to get a little bit rough, like biting her tits, taking control just a bit during sexytimes. We haven't had intercourse more than 6-10 times because of the lack of oppurtunities but the times we do sometimes she almost burst in to tears for no reason. I would try and stop and give her the attention she needed but she always just takes a second to recompose herself and encourages me to continue. One time, before we had a safeword, we were having sex (probably only the second time we had sex) and she said ""hey can we stop for a minute"" and be being the fucking idiot that i am instead pushed her down more and started fucking her harder. I thought she was just saying it playfully, and she choked up and began crying and tried to push me off her and as soon as i realised she was serious i stopped. Point being; i really do not think engaging in verbal degradation/bdsm/bondage will do her mental health any good. At the same time, i do not want to leave her sexually unsatisfied. **I'm lost on what to do. Any advice would be wonderful

Throwaway here, main account can be found. I've been with my gf for 3 years. Recently, like about a month, things have been just a touch shaky. She's been getting clingy and it's been pressuring me just a touch. We've had the space talk before. I am happy with her overall, so is she, but sometimes I feel as if we are together because there is nothing else sometimes. This is my first relationship that has gone past 6 months. My crush is a work crush. We only talk at work. We share a few common interests and I enjoy talking to her. A lot. I've been talking to her more often recently but still, only ever at work. Face to face or work email. She has mentioned being single a few times and mentioned ex-boyfriends but I have avoided revealing my relationship status. I flirt lightly as does she, I think, I can't read her. She gives signs someday, but the next, nothing. Or we just won't talk for a few days since i dont want to be bother and initiate conversation first. In my head, since she revealed, subtly, her single status and takes to my lame jokes, she may be interests. What has been eating at me for a couple weeks is I need to know for sure. Even though I'm in a relationship, I just have to know as I like her a lot. I want to hint about communication via texts instead of work only but still keep it friendly just to see if she would go for it. I love my girlfriend and we are generally happy. But as i mentioned before, sometimes it feels as if we're together out of convenience since we both suck socially. I'll be hurt if this ends but not knowing if my crush likes me too and thought of, ""what if she's the one?"" Kills me.

She says it irritates her legs to shave them everyday and that it's very time consuming. I don't see how it could be that big of a deal seeing as other women do it all the time. Am I right to expect her to shave more often? Should I bring it up more sternly or just let it go? I feel like it's a simple favor to ask and don't understand why she just doesn't do it.

Hi everyone. I've been having a bit of an ongoing problem for a while, but now it's gotten to a point that it needs to be dealt with once and for all. My dad's side of the family is extremely religious, while I have identified as an atheist for about ten years now. I went to church with them until about two years ago just to keep the peace (as well as generally just finding religious texts interesting). When I went off to college, it was very relieving and I felt less restricted by what I could or could not say, including online. I joined the LGBT club at my school and my most recent problem stems from sharing pro-LGBT articles after the recent North Carolina bill. My aunt took offense to such things and messaged me with a bit of hostility that I have forgotten the foundations of our country, and proceeded to guilt me for forgetting the bible and that Christ is my savior. She ends with interrogations on if I have forgotten all of this and, essentially, what happened to make me steer into evil. The last time this happened, it was a bit less forward and I was able to get away with saying that I respect her beliefs and don't look down upon them, but I disagreed on the particular issue we were discussing. Now, I feel that something more severe needs to be said to cut off this behavior, but I don't want to create unnecessary hostility in my family. All I really want is to stop feeling attacked. My grandmother sends me cards with bible verses and handwritten notes regularly. I'm fine with that. I'm perfectly fine with them being religious and am certainly not trying to dissuade them from that. I just want to know what to say to politely ask for her respect in the matter. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.

So at the end of this past summer I moved into a house in a university town, the house having 9 other 20-somethings living in it; most are graduate students but some work in the region. I feel so lucky to have stumbled upon the group.. It's a pretty close-knit bunch yet everyone has their own stuff going on, their own friends outside of the house network, etc. Anyways, there's a girl in the house that I've recently begun feeling something for that extends beyond friendship. I was attracted to her from the start but just sort of wrote it out of my mind, I guess. Upon getting to know her these past 6 or 7 months, though... I'm not sure what happened, exactly, but one day I just started feeling/thinking about her differently. This was about a month ago and in the weeks that followed we sort of increased the exchange of little friendly gestures e.g. exchanging e-mails about things we think would interest the other, texting, etc. Obviously, this is a pretty low-stakes situation. I'm not in love with her by any means, and nothing has occurred between us that would not be totally reasonable within the confines of a platonic friendship. Yet... I do harbor these feelings of desire for her - yes, a genuine desire to get to know her better as a person, but also, to be honest, a physical desire. What can I say? She's very attractive to me. I can say truthfully, though, that my interest in her as a person wouldn't somehow just end if I knew there was 0 chance of romance; I've enjoyed getting to know her all this time when that was virtually off the table (out of my mind at least). Since it's not like I'm contemplating spilling my guts to her (what is there to spill, anyways?) or 'making a move', I guess really all I'm asking is, should I try and just push away the non-platonic feelings that I can feel rising up in me? People talk about the messiness of room-mate/housemate relationships and I can appreciate that sentiment, but should that be the deciding factor in this situation? Thanks for any advice.

I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 years now, we have had troubles like every relationship, but she has never really been open with me. This has put a huge strain on me as I feel like i'm opening my heart to her and she's still not letting me in, no matter how hard I try. I've thought about ending the relationship before but always kept a positive output and it has worked out in the past. I've always known that my girlfriend has had problems with being away from family and stress from work but I never knew how bad it was until now. She has self harmed in the past but always told me it was over something minor and would get annoyed at me when I ask her to be open with me, as talking to others has helped me through dark times in the past I thought it would help, but it just pushed her further away. She came to me this week and told me she had gone to the doctors, she has been diagnosed with severe depression. I feel scared. I worry that any time i express a problem to her it will send her into a spiral of unhappiness. I feel trapped with my own emotions now because I don't want to upset her, I just want to make her happy. But now it is affecting my happiness. I had been strongly considering ending the relationship because I'm not really happy, it just feels like the relationship is there, floating around without it being exciting or something to look forward to. But now she's been diagnosed with depression I feel scared to carry out what I feel best for me because I know how much it will affect her, she told me that I'm the only thing in her life that makes her happy. It will crush her if I leave her, but it's slowly crushing me if I stay. I don't know what to do.

In about October 2014, a friend of mine started dating this girl and she started hanging around us a lot. I was in a relationship at the time. They dated for a year and a few months, they broke up like 3 weeks ago. For the past 8 or so months, I've had very strong feelings for her. I was always physically attracted to her, she's probably one of the most attractive girls I've ever seen. At first it was nothing more than that I thought she was attractive, but over the last 17 months I've developed very strong feelings for her. She was a great girlfriend (objectively) and he was a terrible boyfriend (also objectively). He's basically a textbook narcissist and she is as caring as they come. We had always talked, because she became a part of our little close friend group, so it was just like she was one of 'the guys.' But ever since they broke up we've been talking more, mostly about the breakup, and it's fucking torture. She's had shitty boyfriends in the past and just keeps saying 'why can't I find a guy like (insert quality that I have)' and I feel like screaming at her how she should be with me because I would treat her the way she deserves to be treated. But her ex is my second best friend on the planet (yes he's a huge asshole but he's still one of my best friends). I don't want to start anything whatsoever - it's not worth losing a friend over when the chances are she doesn't reciprocate the feelings. I haven't told anyone and I don't plan on it but I'm going crazy..I figured it was just a stupid little infatuation/crush but it's at the point where it's more than that. On top of that all, she's asked me to hang out like 5 times, just the two of us, but I am afraid to do it in case I can't contain my feelings. Definitely does not help the situation

Long story short, I am going to block her on all social media and on my cell phone. Should I let her know ], or just pull the trigger and go dark?

Reddit I'm scared. I'm scared I'm going to be forever alone. I feel like, I need someone to make me complete, and I know that's not right. I was with my ex for 7 ½ years, we were engaged, everything seems to be going great until last winter and something happened. He called off the engagement this spring but claimed he hasn't give up on us. I just found out this last weekend he was cheating on me earlier this spring prior to calling off the engagement. I feel so empty, lost, lonely, mad, angry, sad, devastated. The relationship is done; I can't recover from what and how it happened. I can't sleep, I can't concentrate at work, and I had a break down today at my desk hyperventilating hysterically today. I'm so embarrassed. I gave him everything I had, my entire soul. I don't think I'm unfortunate looking, I think I'm pretty average. I don't think I'm a horrible person. I have super low self-esteem and confidence. I'm an ex-fatty so my body will never be perfect. All my friends are engaged or married. I'm turning thirty this year and I'm feeling the pressure. I want a family and I might never have one. When I was younger I never thought I would get married, mainly because I never felt like anybody would want to marry me. I've lost contact with all my friends and I don't have very good social skills. My thoughts are all jumbled. He was my first love, my first lover, my first everything. I felt like I was living this fairytale life, everything seemed perfect. I never thought someone like him would love someone like me. I've been seeing a psychologist, but I can't get in to talk to her about my recent discovery until next week Monday. I NEED HELP! Is this normal? I called the doctor today to see if there was anything over the counter or that they could prescribe for me to help numb the pain. And the nurse could only recommend Benadryl for a sleep aid.

Please, no comments about the age difference between my SO and I. We're very happy except for this issue which I need some advice about. **A brief background:** My SO and I have been together over a year. We lived 2.5 hours away from each other, and his roommate was horrible so we decided to move in together in my city. Unfortunately, his father was in an abusive marriage across the country, and the more the merrier right? Well, no. **What's been going on:** My SO's father has issues with alcohol. He'll drink for a few days, be passed out for a few days, and during that time he won't take his medicine which sometimes results in a hospital visit because of his blood pressure (I'm a nursing student, btw. It drives me absolutely crazy). Also, he's told me several times that my SO and I don't do anything around the house and that we make all the mess. This is simply untrue. I dedicate one whole day a week to deep cleaning, along with doing little things like vacuuming everyday. He gets in fights with my SO about things like food and (the fight that is currently happening) Mt. Dew. If someone drinks the last Mt. Dew, even if grocery shopping is happening the next day, all hell breaks loose. **My dilemma:** Simply, I've lost my patience. I'm almost to resort to screaming back at him, that's how bad it is. I want to continue living with my SO, because as I said before we're very happy in our relationship. Not only does his screaming drive my anxiety through the roof (I once had a panic attack in the shower) but in general it's just exhausting dealing with him, my school work, and my job. We're planning on moving from an apartment to a house where I can have my dog. How do I tell my boyfriend that I think **(A)** we should move without him or **(B)** I'm moving in with my grandparents without offending him? How can we continue to be happy with all the **bullshit** his dad puts us through?

Basically, I was dating a guy for a year and a half. He was my first boyfriend and I'm realizing now that the reason I stayed with him so long was that I was scared to be alone again/scared no one else would want me as well as I was too scared to hurt him and end the relationship. But I finally broke up with him a little over a month ago for many reasons... his inability to hold a job, his immaturity, his lack of focus, the fact that he talked so much that I could never get a word in etc. Before we dated we were best friends so I promised that after I broke it off we would remain best friends. But now... I seriously just want nothing to do with him. Every time I talk to him everything he says annoys me, which isn't normal for me because I'm a very patient person. He also acts like he was the greatest love I'll ever have in my life which pisses me off. And I'm also incredible annoyed by the things he talks about and how he handles the situations in his life.

While at work another girl showed interest in me and at first I said no that I am happily in a relationship. Shortly after my girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time, lost the baby. My girlfriend and I spent a week in the hospital with the doctors failing to induce labor for my girlfriend to deliver our stillborn son. Finally they decided to do a c-section. When I returned to work the next week the same girl tried to comfort me by putting my hand on her crotch when we were sitting next to each other. I quickly withdrew my hand but then for some reason(looking back I cant think of a good reason) I put my hand back on her crotch for no more than a minute. I decided (once again for whatever reason) to not tell my girlfriend about it. I then got called in early to work one morning and got fired. On my termination paperwork it had sexual harassment and a form of misconduct when I had been ranting to someone else that the higher ups were ""all hormonal bitches who don't care about their employees"". The reason for ranting was that the higher ups did not want to give me bereavement pay for losing my son. I only told my girlfriend about the latter reason because I did not want to risk losing her. Last night, one of the other people I worked with facebook messaged her the first reason and I am fighting to keep my relationship alive. My girlfriend is everything I have ever wanted. She gives me any attention I want/need, she plays video games with me, she is beautiful, funny, and I believe my soul mate. I know I fucked up royally, by first doing it in the first place, and second my lying and not telling her about it. All I want is forgiveness(in time) and a chance to prove myself loyal to her.

I'll start by saying i'm 22 also, and we both are living with our parents, both recently graduated college and working part-time jobs, looking to start our careers and move in together. We have been together for 4 years now, and things are much different than they once were, for at least the first year of our relationship. When we first got together, she was slightly clingy, but I loved it. We always had great conversations, spent all kinds of time together in bed laughing and just having a great time with each other. She used to wake up before me every morning due to her job, and would send me texts sometimes in the morning to tell me how much she loved me. Fast forward to the present - She sleeps in on her days off until probably noon, she has seemingly no sex drive (when we do actually have sex, it always comes up somehow that she is doing it because she knows I want it, not because she wants to) she rarely ever cooks dinner for me like she used to, and when she does she's pissed off about it. She used to act like she liked the music that i like, but nowadays she complains about any of the music I like and we end up listening to her music, which is exactly the opposite of what I like. I honestly feel like she isn't what I thought she was, and it makes me feel terrible. When I try to talk to her about it, she says that i'm adding to her stress, or she tells me I care about sex too much and it's making her not want to have it, or she just gets upset and cries. I have NO idea what to do. The lack of sex is making me feel frustrated, and the fact that I can't even talk to her about it without a fight makes it ten times worse. Reddit, what can I do??

I got dumped about 5 weeks ago, broke off a 4 year relationship that I really enjoyed. I've been doing No Contact for about four weeks now. About four weeks ago I hung out with a girl I've known from a class last fall. We started to see more and more of one another. I thought it was nice, I'm dating, moving on. About a week ago, I invited her out for my birthday. My ex and I share the birthday, so it was important for me to actually enjoy my own. I've always called it ""our birthday"", and for once in a long time, it was MY birthday. Anyways, the new girl and I ended up in bed together. Cuddling, nothing extremely sexual. A few days ago, she invited me to sleep over. I was hesitant, but went with the flow. It was nice to feel WANTED after feeling like you're trash being thrown away. Things got weird. He probed me about our ""friendship"" and what it was. I told her I honestly don't know but I like hanging out with you. She said she likes me and I said I think I like you too, but I just got dumped and thus I can't really know. We both agreed to go with the flow. My concern is that I don't know where this is going. I'm unsure where it should go. I literally was loving my ex about 6 weeks ago before it came crashing down. My female friends tell me I'm leading this new girl on, that I'm being selfish and that I'm just lonely. They also say she wants more and deserves more than just being a ""cuddle buddy"". I might have to agree with them. In short, I think I have two options. * Distance myself from this new girl for a while. Or * Go with the flow and see where this leads. IMO, option one is probably the better thing to do. Hurt people hurt people, and I'm still a little hurt. Yet, I'm liking what this new girl can offer me. I guess I'm just confused.

Today, my gf told everyone that me and this other girl were dating. And the girl told gf that ""No, I wouldn't do that your my friend and that's fucked up"" Well now, I am kind of in a predicament because I like this girl a lot and it seems like she likes me a lot too. But, since she said that I am not so sure about it now. I was going to ask her today if she likes me above a friend level. Then if she says no well then, I could say that she has nothing to worry about and that she shouldn't feel bad. But, if she says yes then we could date Kind of like a two birds with one stone thing find out if she likes me and tell her not to worry just in case she doesn't. I'm a a male in highschool btw.

Context: Last year, I looked like an average teenage boy with an awful haircut and bad hygiene but was good friends with Tom (fake name). Back then, I was pretty happy with out friendship and we never had any problems. At the end of the year during a 1.5 month long school break, I started working out, got a good haircut and basically just got all my shit together, which I assume made me more attractive (sorry if this sounds cocky). This is where the problem comes in. I've been friends with Tom, who is a vainpot, for 3 years and I guess the new me made him feel a bit insecure, which I understand fully. However, his feelings has escalated to a point where he resorts to physical and verbal means to reestablish his attractiveness (?). He does stuff like violently mess up my hair and pass comments like 'his arms are big but mine are more defined', 'ew why is your stomach so soft', 'i dont like the way your hair looks', 'ew you have dandruff', 'your p**** is small', usually where other people can hear him. Many of these statements are false and/or due to his ignorance of how things work. I should also add that one thing he is most likely jealous about is that I am tall for age here while he is on the short end of the spectrum, which I know for sure because he constantly gets defensive and upset if I mention my height even non-insultingly and he has asked other people why they are tall. He is also a fond gossiper and has talked to shit about other people to me. Other than that, he is otherwise very friendly and seems to think of me as one of his best friends. His statements are always masked as jokes or burns but I always see through his words through his body language and facial expressions. Him and I are a part of a very close-knit group of friends who always hang out together and stuff, making and sort of breaking contact with him very difficult. I am also non-confrontational due to social anxiety and have no idea what to do in this case. Any advice? Thanks in advance.

Hello, I am a 30 year old male. I have had one true love in my life that I feel so strongly for. I knew her since middle school. As time went, we hung out, became close friends. She lit up my life - a smile and a ""hi"" were all I needed from her to turn the worst day into a great day. We drifted in High School, then came back in late HS and stayed connected in College. I expressed my feelings, she didnt feel the same. We drifted apart - eventually I cut her out of my life. It was pretty cold turkey - went from hanging out to ignoring her as i couldnt stand seeing her with other guys (dating). At the time, I felt it was the best thing for me but now looking back I do feel bad. Now, I still think about her. Nobody has ever made me feel the way I did when with her. I have reached the point that I want to try again at her and contact her. I do not believe she is married. It would take some digging for me to find her but believe i could (IE facebook). My question is, for the ladies, if you had a close friend that cut you out of their life, then tried to re-connect with you 10 years later, would you? Would you believe people change and maybe date them? Would you forgive them? Would you understand what they were going through and understand it? I feel like this girl is the only girl that can bring me happiness and I really want to reconnect with her.

We have many obstacles and problems, and a couple of weeks ago we stumbled on one. So we had a discussion(more like a fight) and I was clearly the upset one and also the one to blame. I accepted my mistakes and moved on. And then... I am pregnant, miles and miles away. I didn't know that I would be pregnant. And he has been working while I have been at school, one more year to go. He always wanted kids and I'm all for them, I just wanted to get married and finish my education. I don't know if he hasn't had any other feelings about this relationship, breaking up, or cheating yet. He never hints at it, he is extremely loving and he gives it all to me. It's really hard to find someone who is completely and utterly in love with you, after 3 years. (this is my first serious relationship) I've said before we had an argument the last time we saw each others faces. We call, we text and message everyday and say""I love you.

So I have decided to ask my girlfriend of four years to marry me, we have a big weekend break away coming up and I think it would be the perfect occasion - we've been together through ups and downs, we're in a good place financially, and she's my best friend - I can't think of a future without her in it. I would like to ask for her parents' blessing but unsure about the best way to approach it. Her parents are divorced and live in separate parts of the country (UK), and we live in another part as well. I want to ask both parents for their blessing as feel it would not be fair to leave one out. The issue is how I go about it - I can't appear on their doorstep out of the blue and similarly, I can't call up without instantly giving it away. I get on with both of her parents so think it will be fine asking them. My current plan is to ask to meet over the phone and be honest if they ask why, but still go ahead with meeting in person. Is that the best approach? I had to secretly steal their numbers off my girlfriend's phone as while we get on, we've not been close enough to talk like that.

Later i find out she's still in contact with her ex, and decides she wants to move to that state in a couple of months. I feel the relationship is done, I'm just struggling to handle it.

I'm a shitty person. My closest friend (and roommate since we live together in college) was sad four days ago and wanted a hug / physical signs of affection. I don't like being touched sometimes and I really did not want to be touched that time. I didn't want to touch her so I backed away and she was upset and said it ""hurt"". To be honest, the fact that she said it hurt disgusted me. I don't like to think she has emotional feelings. I don't give a fuck if she's hurt. I want her to stop being so emotional and stop needing things from me like physical affection. We've been close for the past few months (texting every day, being verbally affectionate, hugging when I see her) and now I feel feelings of disgust for her and like I detest her and I'm ghosting on her. I've been avoiding her and she fucking knows. What the fuck is wrong with me. I'm cutting her out of my life because I feel disgust for her. Whenever else she shows sad emotions, I can't deal with it but I quickly remove myself from the situation and we're back to normal when she's not sad anymore. A few months ago, she was tearing up because she was stressed and didn't get a job. I said words of comfort, initiated physical contact, and then left. I didn't feel disgusted then, but I didn't want to be around her and I blocked out all emotions. How do I fix this? I can't go on like this because I fucking live with her and it's the elephant in the room. But I can't bring myself to touch her or treat her intimately. What do I do?

First of all, sorry if I am posting in a wrong reddit section. So the day I had my first class in college, I was sitting next to this girl, who seemed to have some interest in me in the first day. As usual, I add everyone I meet on Facebook so that I may/give help in the future. So I've added her, and looking at some of her posts, and she posts pictures with love phrases, coincidental or not, they were posted a couple days we met. Couple months passed, but she didn't have any ""interest"" (like saying hi, smiling, etc.) as before. I'm a pretty shy person, so I didn't have the courage to ask her out. One day, I asked to learn Chinese from her and she accepted, and when we sat next to each other, I looked her in the eye for a couple good seconds. She looked away, smiling, so I guessed she still liked me. Now, I could've just went for her if she liked me, and it'd go out smoothly, right? Well, one day, I overheard some chatting and I found that she has a boyfriend. With some speculation, I think the boyfriend is not with her in college and in some other country. But I'm absolutely sure she has one.

I am in my beginning forties, she's in her ending thirties. Our relationship is over five years old, with some highs and lows. What bothers me about it is that she has a recurring need for drama. If everything is sunny and carefree, you can be dead sure that it won't stay that way. It is always the small things that lead to major conflicts. For example, she's jumping on the jealousy train. She demands that I break off all contact to a girl. I shouldn't do as much as saying ""Hello"" or exchange a couple of sentences in everyday conversation. Why? It is because of her emotions. *She doesn't like it, it hurts her. And if I really love her, I surely must avoid to hurt her.* I need to follow through and stop talking to that person at all - or I am a major asshole and I'm showing that I have no real feelings for her. Of course, an asshole get's treated as an asshole. Heated and with snide and hurting comments in the fight, and cold afterwards - or even silent. While I agree in principle - if I love someone, I won't hurt him/her on purpose - I feel controlled and manipulated. It can't be sanely demanded from an adult person to just cut contact to anybody she displeases, or can it? And that was just an example. It is the same pattern with all other relationship conflicts. She's playing the ""her emotions must'n be hurt under any circumstances"" card and if I am resisting to be controlled, it's big bang time. After some time, she's ready and willing to start over, but the bottom line of the previous conflict is always the same: I am the bad guy who isn't respecting her precious and fragile emotions enough. As I'm writing this, I am asking myself why I'm having masochistic tendencies or why I'm enduring this. Besides running for the hills, is there any approach to treat this better?

Is this normal? I'm getting hit with depression, feeling lonely without a solid social circle. I lost mine many years ago after not staying in touch due to some real bad depression and anxiety... Gf and I don't really have many friends, we've lost touch with many, and spend most of our time just with each other when we hang out. I have a problem developing and sustaining authentic friendships. I am introverted by nature, once I feel someone has labeled me as quiet or introverted I find it hard to be myself around them. I'd like to have a better social life (doesn't matter if it is just me or my gf also included) but find it very hard to develop into a regular socializing/hanging out routine with people when everyone already seems so solidified into their groups.

Hello! Okay so I just want your advice on the situation I'm in. So I got my crush's number and her snapchat. I sent her a pic of me just saying hi (was that a good idea?) this morning and she finally responded. Her snap was just a pic of her that didn't say anything. I don't know if I should snap her back, maybe she'll think it's creepy? I'm not really sure. I think there's interest, she likes all of my fb status and pics and stuff and we get along really well, but I don't want to make things awkward. Thanks! Also, should I even be doing the snapchats/texts? Or does that make it seem too friendly?

We broke up a few months ago due to some horrible decisions on my part and just recently decided to start things over. However, it seems like she is going out of her way to get upset at something....today I was telling her my plan for the near future as well as we talked about buying a house. Somehow the people we dated during the separation came up In condo so I asked her what they had that I lacked, and if she was more attracted to them than to me. She just responded with ""I won't tell you that because it might hurt your feelings."" So now I feel like she is settling. Another thing that bugs me is she has access to my Facebook and I back every text I get to an email that she can access (due to old trust issues) and now every time I get the chance to see her and our son she is snap chatting and texting the whole time, but won't tell me to who. One last thing, last week she texted me very upset that a friend blew her off and I asked which friend and she said it's none of my business. But she did admit that it was a guy, that's all she would say. None of these things are all that terrible, but I live 400 miles away from them and so every little thing makes me worry I might lose her.She has never given me a reason to not trust her.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a bit over 3.5 years now. We have lived together for almost 2 now. We are very happy together for the most part, but we do have some periods of ""blah-ness"" and periods of awesome awesomeness. I respect him immensely, I love him deeply and we get along incredibly well. We have had several discussions about our future together and in the beginning, these did not go so well. He was not ready to discuss these things and I felt terrible for bringing it up. These early conversation have definitely adversely effected how I felt about our future at the time as I pushed away any thoughts of a proposal. Well, now things have changed somewhat and we are definitely able to discuss our future more naturally. These discussions, however, usually lead nowhere definitive, but generally strike a positive tone. I am ready to make some big changes in my life career-wise. I told him this much and said, 'I need to know where we stand so I can make the best decisions for myself and my career."" I am considering going back to school, and would consider an out-of-state school if we came to the conclusion that our relationship is not heading towards marriage. In the past, we've had similar discussions but like I said earlier, they never really lead anywhere. So this time, we decided that we would take 10 days and journal out all of our thoughts. At the end of the 10 days we'll meet and share our thoughts and go from there. At this point, I truly have no idea what is going to happen or what we are going to conclude. I think it is a possibility that we will not make a decision, and continue to go on as we have. Neither one of us wants to make a decision about our relationship! So - question to y'all: Over these next 10 days - what should I do? What questions should I ask myself?

I met what was my former girlfriend on a mixed sports team at University. We developed feelings for each other, and about six months ago, we start dating and eventually become a couple. Every so often, lately, we'd have petty arguments over really small things. These usually stem from the stresses of things that we do together, i.e. we organise a club together and also her things with being in the final year of University and other projects. I have a problem at verbally lashing out at this girl. It's something I'm ashamed of, and she's been kind enough to take it for a while, but the other night, she decided enough was enough. She said that we should break up, but with a bit of soul searching, she came over and said that she really wanted a break like she originally intended. When she left, she said that we would then become friends and see what happens from there. Things came to a head yesterday when we trained together, and I found it really difficult to control my emotions. She said she wanted space so she could get her thoughts together and also so she could concentrate on her final year work. It really chips away at you when you're forced to look at someone you still love from a distance, and I ended up calling her asking for some explanation of where we stood. In the end, it came to a boil and I ended up deciding to take a break from the club we run together and I removed all contact to her from my computer/phone. I've had some sleep and now I feel like I should focus on the greater good and be there for the team. Maybe eventually approach her as a friend like we were before and see what can come of it. What should I do?

I challenged myself to ask out the prettiest girl of all of my four classes as an experiment. The goals were to even have the balls to ask her out, since I never talked to her much, and handle rejection well. Well she said yes to my proposal of walking to a close by coffee shop. I was proud of myself for keeping my energy levels high, keeping up conversation, and avoiding mundane ""So where do you work,"" or, ""what are you studying,"" questions. We both had a great time, it felt like. We were laughing and talking as if we had known each other for a while. Considering I had never asked out a girl before, or have done any type of ""first date"" scenario I made a couple of fatal mistakes. Firstly I didn't make physical contact throughout the date so that only helped me chicken out of kissing her. The second mistake was giving her my number as opposed to getting her number. Everyone, even my councilor, told me that was a no-no. Girls apparently like it when the guy starts the conversations at first. After the date I continued to over analyze everything that went wrong, I couldn't tell if she only said yes out of being polite or not. At the end she gave me that Christian side hug, but she agreed to wanting to go out again. I also don't know if that was just being polite. Here we are today, a week later, and my mom comments that I should Facebook message her. Two other friends and my councilor told me to do the same. I feel like it's too weird and that if she wanted to go out again she would text me. I know it is a busy time, since it is finals' week, but I feel like she still would have texted me. I had a really good time with her, but still think going through Facebook is creepy. Should I message her like my friends want me to do?

And she just started laughing and said she's joking around, I asked her to leave and she said no and that she didn't have a ride home, I said maybe you should've thought about that before touching my boyfriend, and she called me a bitch, at this point I was beyond pissed and I dug my nails into her arm and just kinda kicked her out. Then she was banging on our door and calling my phone for like 10 minutes before she left, now she's been texting me asking if we can meet up and discuss things, and asking ME to apologize to her. Did I overreact? I know I probably went total overprotective gf but I can't believe she did that and tried to shrug it off as a joke. How did I handle the situation? What should I do now?

We have been together for a year and a half. I am here first proper boyfriend and she put her trust in me. I do love her but I feel I am no longer in love with her. She has been away for the whole summer and she asked me about going before hand and if it would change things between us, I said it wouldn't, thinking it wouldn't. We have made promises to each other for life commitment and kids etc, I realise now these are promises I shouldn't of made as how could I know how I would feel in the future? Since she has gone and from a bit before she went I have been having these feelings/thoughts. Nearly every hot girl I see I feel like I want to fuck her/approach her and chat but I can't because I am in a relationship, I want to be a free man again. I feel like I am too young to be in a committed relationship for the rest of my life, I have a problem with having only this one sexual partner for the rest of my life. I want to have some more partners and not another long term relationship for another say 10 years. I like being by myself which is another thing, sometimes I get annoyed when I dont get time to myself. I have actually been enjoying my time to myself while she has been away. So she is back in a month and sure I can't stay in this relationship, I don't want to end it while she is there as she will be devastated when If I do it and I don't want to ruin her trip. I want to know the best way to let her down gently. This has to happen as if I am having these feelings now, if I stay, how will I feel in 10 years let alone the rest of my life. I feel it is best to break up now rather than let it be even worse in the future. I know she will be sad but at the end of the day it is my feelings that matter to me and I know I won't be happy staying in the relationship. So, what is the best way to explain this to her without her being too hurt? Thanks

Using throwaway because GF knows my username. I have been dating that girl I love for 3 months and everything is/was great. When we started dating, girlfriend told me about that guy who broke her heart last year. He cheated and left her. She said she thought she loved him but she now knows it wasn't love. So everything has been good but last week I looked at her social media and noticed she was talking about her ex. She was being pretty mean, like ex girlfriends can be. It's okay I think... But after reading her updates it was clear that she was still checking his online profiles. I looked a little more and noticed she had been talking about or alluding to that ex boyfriend a lot in the last month or so. She is always very mean when she posts an update about him. She calls him names and posts cryptic comments about his updates and says he's a loser. We're pretty serious and met each other's families, but she's been posting about him more than she's been posting about me. That made me feel a little bad. She dated other guys after him (including one who also broke her heart) but she doesn't seem to talk about the others. She's just mad about that ex boyfriend. Also looked up the guy's profile and he seems happy, now in a relationship. I don't know what to think. I haven't told anyone yet but this whole thing makes me feel bad.

I've been with my bf for a year. We're in love, we're thinking of a future together, we moved in together 4 months ago...BUT. I feel that I am doing a lot of effort to make him happy, because I love him and seeing him happy makes me happy. But on the other side he is fine with making me happy as long as it does not require too much effort. In the end it seems to me like I do most of the chores and of what I would call ""attempts to bond"". Pleasuring him, little surprises, ironing his shirts so he doesn't have too, etc. But more and more I feel like he's just not, you know, into doing much about me. What spouted this post is that a few days ago, we were both starting work after the Christmas holidays and both having a bad day, so when I got home I made him a set of little ""sex game"" cards, one of which being ""I'm your slave for the day"". We talked about it today and he had ton of ideas buy when I jokingly mentioned that the day after he uses the card I'd like him to be caring of me (you know, cuddly and loving and maybe since I do pretty much all the chorea all the time, do some himself) he laughed and just said ""no"". Anyways I want to have a conversation with him about this. An adult conversation about how I feel and the state of things and see if we can share the chores better and I'm looking for ways to communicate this without seeming like a, well, a needy bitch.

I know this might sound like a shallow post, but lately it has been bothering me more and more. As v-day is coming up, I realized that my bf is not really planning anything at all. We won't be spending it together anyway, but I already am having something delivered to him for the day. He, however, doesn't even know the address I'm staying at and has no interest of asking me. For last valentines day, we didn't do anything. We didn't even go out to dinner. He said he was going to get me the gift that I wanted, but it took him over a month after to finally order it. For our 1 year, we didn't even go out to dinner. I made him a very special gift, but I got nothing in return. For Christmas, he said he was going to get me something (I got him something and he knew that), and then when Christmas came around, I got nothing. This isn't a dealbreaker because I obviously love him a lot, but it especially makes me shitty when people around me are being spoiled by their boyfriends. I don't want him to spend a lot of money on me at all. I don't care if the gifts are handmade or $5. The reason I feel like a bitch even posting this and why I'm uncomfortable sharing this with him is because he got me a fairly expensive birthday gift (although it was also late by a month and I felt awful reminding him to buy it several times), and he received money from his parents to come visit me (which also costs a lot). So I feel like a spoiled brat asking him to do even more, but at the same time, I'm just looking for small gestures...

I feel like he wants me to change because I'm not good enough for him. He says that's not what he means but just the fact that if I ""maintained"" it, it would be easier to have sex.

I've been miserable about this for a couple weeks now so I'm looking for a chance to vent and look for some advice. This is gonna be a long chunk of text. My girlfriend and I just graduated high school. We've been together for a little over a year. Now I know the stereotype, ""highschool relationships are dumb anyway, who cares"", but it's not like that. The past year has been bliss, we're compatible, we have a lot in common, she's the least dramatic teenage girl I know. No nonsense, good communication, we've been very happy. We agreed a few months ago that when the summer comes to a close, it's over. Neither of us will have the time/means to pursue long distance during college (she will be in new york, I will be in indiana, pretty big difference). Even if we did, I have never heard of a long distance relationship really working out well. I thought for a while that a totally consensual, circumstantial breakup would be better, because there isn't any resentment. I was wrong. Both of us are miserable. Knowing that she doesn't want it to end is making the anticipation so much worse. I'd prefer being dumped because then I could act all angry, ""she's a bitch, what's wrong with her, I never cared about her anyway"". But I can't, because none of that is true. I know it's just a high school relationship. I know the whole ""plenty of fish in the sea"" argument. But I'm gonna miss her so much. Does anybody have experience with this? Can anybody offer some friendly advice? It would mean a lot.

My sister seems to have a rather unhealthy relationship with her husband, and that spills out to affect me and my hometown friends. Here's the crux of it: her husband is still working a service job 4 years out of college, and she is now a tenured teacher. They don't have enough money to have kids (their area is high COL and she now can't move because of tenure), and he seems to feel emasculated because of his lack of career success. Anyway, whenever I visit (which is every month or so, as I live only a few hours away), she and he will get far drunker than the rest of us, and he will break something or randomly storm off. She will then berate him or become hysterical, and we (my hometown friends and I) will have to deal with the fallout. Two recent examples: He threw a champagne glass in the street (at a restaurant!) after some comment she made, stormed off and turned off his phone. Of course, she didn't have her house key, and my friend had to let her stay over for the night. More recently, he kicked a cab when the cabbie wouldn't let the five of us ride (obviously). She then immediately started berating him and yelling at him. He threatened to walk home (like 5 miles...), and she started following. My friends left, but I stuck around and eventually successfully coaxed them both into a cab. After both incidents neither of them wanted to talk about it / denied that anything happened. My dad is rather distant, and my mother passed away a few years ago, so I'm the only family she's got. Nonetheless, I don't know what to do. I told her several years ago not to marry this guy, as his level of employment was not compatible with her life goals, and she got mad. Now they fight all the time. What to do?

I met my current girlfriend back in September and things progressed pretty quickly we spent lots of time together (probably too much) very quickly but it was fun and exciting and what not. I went home for winter break (graduate student) and when I came back things did not feel the same but continued normally. A couple weeks ago I started a pretty big project and got very busy, I let her know I would be busy and working more and it would be easier if we didn't see each other every evening. By the time the project was over I realized my work was much better and more focused than usual. I also noticed that I was much more excited to see her after having a couple days to myself. She however was not very happy about those days. I came to the conclusion that between school and seeing her everyday I'm getting burnt out. We sat down and chatted about it (we agreed early on that our careers would always come first) and concluded that 3-4 times a week would be much better than every day. That was fine and dandy but now that we are doing this she seems very very very bitter, and passive aggressive about not seeing each other every day. I tried talking to her about it again and it was the same conversation as last time she agreed and it went right back to the bitter / passive aggressiveness. Is there a better way to approach this? It's been about 3 weeks and she's normal in person but right back to passive aggressive if we don't see each other for a day.

I have been seeing my boyfriend for a couple of months now, and we are very serious together. He is a great person and everything I want in a partner, so really nothing that I have issue with is actually his fault, but I can't stop being bothered about his past and comparing myself to his exes. Before he was with me, he was engaged to another girl, and they went through a long romance. As in the sort of romance you hear about in the books, right down to proposing on top of the Eiffel Tower. Of course, they aren't together anymore, and the relationship went horrible so here we are today, but I am having a really hard time getting over that part of him. In a way I think it is because I have never had that sort of past. Though I have had long relationships they have not been that good, and I was already battling with the fact that he's been engaged before and so it wouldn't be as special if we were to ever get engaged. Now knowing how he did it it's made it even worse because how could anything we do ever compare with that? It's like my mind doesn't mind about the fact that it went bad, even though it was negative for years, it just hears the rest of it and makes me feel bad. It was never his intention to make me feel bad and he tried his hardest to make me see that it didn't matter, but it's playing on my mind quite a lot and I can't stop thinking about it to the extent that it's affecting my thoughts towards our relationship. I feel pathetic even complaining about this, but how can I get around thinking about this in this way?!

I know its bad for being kinda salty about the fact that my girlfriend no longer wants to have sex with me. For the 2 years and a bit that we have been together, at the beginning it was always happening. Then now she all of a sudden she just cut physical activity entirely, closest i get it just a makeout session. Like im madly in love with this girl, and i wanna really show it to her. I literally give her all my free time, and i try to keep her company as much as i possibly can. Also, its not even the whole no physical activity thing is bothering me. Even when we did do it, id be able to get her off.. then after she would just lay there, and tell me to just stroke myself until i climax. Idk, im sorry this is terribly written. I just feel stupid as i type this out. Sorry... i guess, i know i sound like a pig.. and i get it, its her body so she should do what she wants to do... idk

We have been seeing each other for about 18 months but dating exclusively for about 10 months. We are slowly moving forwards (meeting each other's family, talking about getting a place together within next couple of years). The point is, we are getting serious but not married yet, however the understanding was we are exclusive. He seems to have a very different understanding of ""cheating"". To him, if there isn't flesh-on-flesh contact, it really doesn't matter. I've told him a few times I do not agree, and I explained very clearly what cheating is to me. Due to the fact we spend every day together and we often work side-by-side (and sometimes I use his laptop and vice-versa), I have noticed things that bother me. The worst was that a woman he knows on Facebook (she lives 3 hours away) has sent him sexy nude pics for several years now, even though she's in a relationship. She has continued this even after he and I have been together....bum shots, breast shots, etc. He replies by telling her how good she looks and he'd love to be ______ her, etc. I freaked out over this and he said he didn't tell her to stop previously because he didn't want to embarass her. But now he did tell her he's in a relationship and asked her to stop for my sake. She apologized and agreed to, and he said he ""unfollowed"" her posts but remained friends. Am I way out of line here by thinking he should unfriend her completely? He said he won't do that because it's not her fault.......she didn't know he was with me.

So my girlfriend of two years and I have a good relationship. We're currently long distance but we've lived together before. She recently met a guy that shares a lot of interests with her and they became friends. She has a lot of guy friends and I've never had a problem with that. Except for this one because I can feel he wants more. So we've been arguing recently because I feel like she does things with him that are more than friendly. For instance, last week he invited her to a big children's amusement park with him and his son. She went and spent the entire day with them and stayed to watch a movie after his son went to sleep. Other similar things have happened that I think are a little more than ""just friend"" activities. I want to clarify that I know she's not cheating and I think she's just a little naive in thinking he doesn't want more. But do you think I am just being paranoid or should I just confront this guy?

She and her ex [17 M] aren't having troubles exactly but I think she is starting to like him again and all I know about him is his name and that they dated for a year or so. So my problem is how I go about these feeling I have for her. Do I try to ask her now and face good odds of getting rejected, wait for the odds to get better, or just forget about this and move on to someone else (but still be friends because I don't want to be the jerk who ignores girls he doesn't get).

I developed feelings for a friend of mine. He is great and is literally everything I have ever wanted in a guy. He never reciprocated the feelings back. I did not admit to them, and I don't want to either because I don't want to ruin the friendship. I've been single for a long time and I know its the attention that I liked, not necessarily him (infatuation). Right now I have been distancing myself, and he asked me why but I told him it was school related. I'm really just trying to get over him because being with him and seeing him flirt with other girls is hurtful. Will it be possible for us to ever be friends? Should I give up on the friendship? Will I get over these feelings and settle for friendship? I don't know what to do. Please help :(

So i just got a new job working on the checkouts of my local supermarket to pay my way while I'm looking for a graduate job since finishing university. About 20 other people started at the same time as me, all doing our training/shifts together, so we all got pretty close and made friends fast. The closest I've got to anyone there is a girl, let's call her E. We don't get much time to talk at work but it's pretty much non-stop outside of it. I give her lifts home, we text a lot, and it's progressing from there really. Now here's the interesting bit for me. We're both aware there's something there between us, and we've been talking steadily more and more for the past 3 weeks or so. I looked her up on facebook to add her about a week or so ago, and i was pretty weirded out when it said she was in a relationship, and had been for over a year. She'd never eluded to having a boyfriend, and had even told me she was single at one point before i looked her up. This kinda put me on edge a bit, because i didn't really know where to go from there. I kinda cooled it off a little with the talking because i knew it wasn't fair on this other guy flirting with his girlfriend. i don't think she uses facebook too much, but when i saw she'd accepted, i was pretty weirded out even more. Suddenly it said there was no relationship info to show; could mean she's either hiding her relationship from me or is newly single. I'm dropping her home from work tomorrow, and we've started the talking again, and we both know it could get a bit more intense, so I've got a few questions i guess. Should i confront her about this? Or just assume she's now single - and if she is, is it my fault? Can i trust her?

This is something that we've been dealing with for the entire two years we've been living together and I'm so sick of it. A few weeks ago, I came up with a cleaning schedule because I hate having a messy place and my girlfriend doesn't always pull her weight. I thought the schedule would fix all that. Everything is divided up equally and we both agreed on it. It alternates so Monday is my day, Tuesday is her day, Wednesday is my day etc. There are only one or two things for each of us to do per day, its not like a whole list of stuff. It worked great for a little while, but she has a hard time sticking to it. That brings us to this morning. The same dishes have been in the sink for three days. I texted her and said ""I noticed you didn't do your chores yesterday :-)"" I thought that was gentle and non-accusing, but apparently I was wrong. Her response was that I should go grocery shopping then. I asked if she was mad and she said something to the effect of ""I hate it when you nag."" Bitch, what? Nagging is repeatedly asking and harassing someone and that's definitely not what I did. Were still texting about it right now. I really wish we could talk in person, but she's at work and so am I. I'm pretty pissed right now. I feel like if I don't say something to remind her, it won't get done and all the cleaning will fall back on me once again. I've explained that to her, but she just doesn't get it. Am I being unreasonable? I try to be super sweet when I remind her, but it doesn't seem to matter. And its not that often that I do remind her, so I don't feel like I'm nagging. I'm leaning towards just doing all the cleaning myself so we don't have to deal with this. She just told me that she's gonna do some cleaning this evening and she loves me, but I drive her crazy... :-(

Really close right from the get go, hang out all the time, got in bed quickly but she tells me she is a virgin so me being me I said okay thats fine we can take it slow. Fast forward three months, she was going to sleep over, we were kind of high and we start having sex. I thought everything was great! I'm pumped, I hadn't sex in months bc I was talking to her and not fooling around with other girls. But then she asked me how many girls I had been with before, I lied and said 4. We continue to have sex a few times but it never felt great. She wasn't all that into it. Any tips? Fast forward another month, out of the blue, she texts me I know you fucked this girl, you lied to me all this shit. I tell her my real number and she instantly goes into this cocoon like state, she wont talk to me, i brought her flowers, i really tried hard to get to forgive me. Winter break: We were talking every night on skype for hours. I live in California, she lives in Texas. But then the other day she called and said she is really angry with me and needs time and space. I said thats fine and she can have her time.

I have been in love with this girl for almost 3 years. I asked her out around 4 months in and she said no and ignored me for two weeks. I did my best to talk to her again and she started to talk back. Then she got really close with this one guy. She said they weren't going out, but they held hands and went out to the movies together. After a while they ""broke up"" in January. I took the opportunity and bought her a rose for Valentines day. She accepted it. And she flirted with me that day. Then towards the end of the month she had fallen in love with some Puerto Rico guy she met on Skype. This really ticked me off. I have been working my ass off for her and all of a sudden she falls in love with a guy she only talked to for an hour? I got pissed and out of anger I messaged her : Fuck You, just fuck you. Then the same happened, she wouldn't talk to me for nearly a month. I've been trying to apologize for my stupidity but she kept ignoring me. I don't know how I did it but things have been back to normal for about 5 months. She and he have had a long distance relationship for 7 months now. And now I'm questioning if I should just let her go. But I dont want to. If it wasn't for me, she probably would have stayed as a quiet girl, rather than an outgoing one. I can't let go of her. I've tried, but it always fails. I need her.

Have you ever met someone who was just like you down to the smallest details? But in every way, they were also better than you? Funnier, prettier, taller, more charismatic, intelligent. I have this in a close friend. We have a tight relationship, and it's really starting to throw me for a loop. She is my copy in the strangest ways, it freaks me out sometimes. Lately, I can't help but think that my husband would be so much happier with her, like had he known she existed, he would have gone for her. I've been rendered entirely insecure. It's so unfair, too, because my husband hasn't done anything for me to even feel like this. He's bewildered by my recent insecurities. I've become so afraid that one day he'll realize he can do better. I think because he's younger than me and my friend is also younger than us both... I don't know. Either way, I'm tired of putting him through this and feeling like this. He chose to marry me, we chose to commit to each other. We're each other's first loves, too. I think that plays a lot into this, too. As in, he doesn't even know what he's missing out on! But yeah. It's putting a strain on our marriage with my constant need for reassurance and while he's more than supportive, it's stressing us both out. Thank you.

Which wouldn't bother me so much if she didn't say they weren't friends, same as how she told me she wasn't going to go meet up with the guy I mentioned previously and then less than an hour later she lets slip that she had already planned on meeting him.

We'd only known each other a year then. The problem is that he has serious anger issues and has actually become abusive - most recently physically, as in he has attempted to actually harm me. I know I should leave. I'm not sure why I'm *not* running for the hills - I don't *like* being treated this way at all! Today was another in a long series of last straws and I'm... not sure what to do about it, to be honest. I have a habit of playing games and the like on my days off - since, you know, days *off* - and he thoroughly dislikes it. Today he barged in on me while I was playing, took my car keys and told me to turn off ""that fucking digimon fucking pokemon fucking shit"" and help him move some of his power tools, or he was taking my car. I fought back, he told me I was going to the psych ward (protip: nope) and here we are, several hours later, with me posting a disjointed ramble on Reddit.

To say I have anxiety issues is under stating it. \ I broke up with my ex last Monday. I was devastate to do so because I'm wildly in love with him and have been for three years. He's my best friend, my confidant. He's been my everything. I left him because he did not treat me a well as I deserved, took my love and affection for granted, and possibly lead another girl on, if not cheated with her. He denies that last bit, in direct opposition to a text I saw on his phone. (I have no proof save for a text from a girl I know who likes him accusing him of having a girlfriend). He pleaded with me for another chance. Begged. Told me he would do anything. He said we could slowly rebuild and he would change to make me happy. I said no. We finalized the breakup on Sunday. And I've never been in this much pain. I'm over-eating. I can't sleep without dreaming of him. This morning I saw that he had defriended and blocked me and I crumbled. While taking a shower, I just sat on the floor of my tub and cried for 15 minutes. I'm at work and I'm still crying. I want to go back to him, even though I'm wary things won't change. I just love him so much. I want us to be happy together. Thinking of a future without makes me sick. Thinking of him with another girl makes me sicker. I'm so weary and confused.

I've met this really handsome, funny and nice guy. I'm trying to move past this jerk I've been seeing, and have finally found someone who I really like. Because of mentioned jerk, I'm insecure about whether this guy likes ME specifically, or is just flirty and wants to get laid. We've known each other for about 2 months, and we hang out every weekend and sometimes after I'm done with school. He sleeps over, and slept in my bed last night (just snuggled). We took a nap on the beach, alone, today. We've become close. Normally I would have kissed the guy by now, but I'm not looking for something strictly casual and I'm taking my time to see if this will become something. So everything is going great, I feel like this guy really likes me.... and he has sex with my friend. Now, my friend asked me since she knows I kind of like him, and I said go for it I have no claim over this guy. We've never kissed! So I'm also not upset with the guy for doing that because I sure wasn't giving him good signals. But now I'm learning my friend has felt that this guy really likes her because they talk all the time, hang out alone at parties, have a connection, etc... Basically, he's treating her like he treats me.

Hey guys, would really appreciate some advice. My (F18) little sister (F14) has been posting increasingly ""sexier"" pictures on Instagram and Facebook, the worst being this morning where her cleavage is clearly the focus of the picture. I've tried telling her it's inappropriate but she doesn't listen to me and thinks I'm just being annoying. For context, our relationship isn't the best. I had severe anorexia a few years ago while we were both young (15 and 11 respectively) and it really threw a spanner into the works of our relationship. Then a few years later I had an abusive girlfriend who groomed and manipulated my sister against me and we're still recovering from the aftermath of that too. As such we aren't super close... Also I looked after her all the time growing up so I feel more like a mum than a sister to her and I don't like talking about sex/boys/hearing her swear etc like most sisters do because it feels like she's my kid. She also finds me naggy and ""mum-ish"". And she's pubescent and super irritable/emotional/always picking fights at the moment. I joined MMA classes with her to bond and also let her deal with her anger problems but I work too much to make the classes these days. I'm worried about her safety, I've been preyed on by older men when I was her age (like 30 year old dudes when I was 14) and I don't like her putting these pictures up for everyone to see, I know she's learning about sexuality but the internet isn't the place to do that. How do I get her to take down the pictures without driving her further away from me?

Hey, so before I'm called stupid and retarded, I KNOW. I should have never trusted anyone and I even had a gut feeling it was a fake email but ""she"" sent pictures too, and she knew some things about my hometown so I assumed she was legit. I even asked straight up, is this a real email and are you a real person and she said yes. So after I sent the pictures of myself (none of which included my face), ""she"" confessed to actually being a guy and saying they just wanted to get pictures of some hot girl. They claim to have deleted the pictures but obviously I'm not dumb enough to fall for that. So go ahead and tell me how dumb I am, I'm full aware of that just curious as to what I should do. Would I get in trouble for distributing child porn? or would they get in trouble for possession? I feel so disgusted in myself for being so slutty and not careful but it's so hard to find bi girls here, and ""she"" was really hot so I wasn't thinking. :(

We've been together for a year and five months. Our relationship has been extremely unique and I've sacrificed a lot to be with him. I moved to a different state to be near him almost a year ago while he finishes up graduate school. He's been offered a job in our home state for when he graduates in May. We're both really excited to be near our friends and family again. We are really happy together and have just recently adjusted to living together in the same house together for 3 months now). So, everything is falling into place except for my career path. I have been taking online classes so that I don't have to pay out of state tuition, but I will be in school full time starting in May. Basically the issue is that his job is in his hometown 2 hours away where I'm from. We lived there this past summer and I hated it. The population there is ~650 people. SUPER small. Everyone knows everyone else basically. They all treated me as an outsider and did not care to know me whatsoever. I've told my boyfriend all of this and he understood. He agreed that we can live in a different city so he can commute to his job while I go to school somewhere close to where we live. It all sounds great until I get online and really do my research and find there's one school to choose from and hardly any houses to rent. It's just really discouraging and I feel like I'm living his life constantly. I really struggle sometimes because I feel like I don't have my own identity anymore. Is it normal to feel like this? Do I just stick with the plan with a smile on my face?

Me and my gf have been going out for 8 months and we're pretty happy together, haven't been in many relationships because I'm pretty young but I still really like being with her. Anyway I'll try keel it short, basically an hour or so before making this post she was struggling to get me off because she's not used to it which I've gotten used to and its never bothered me, I used to think it was because she wasn't strong enough but after a while I'm starting to think from her comments ""too lazy"" and ""can't be stuffed"" that she just doesn't care about my pleasure even though I happily do the same when she asks or obviously want it because I feel it's my job as the boyfriend to give her pleasure as well as being her equal in a relationship. But what the problem I've just had is her comment about a suggestion that I was almost too embarrassed to say: because she struggles to get me off I said that she could sorta grind me with her butt (she has a really nice butt) and I could get off like that, after saying that she kinda laughed a little too loud and just said ""you're strange"" then basically got her pants on and walked to the bathroom. What really hurt was the fact that she laughed in my face even though I said that I was embarassed about suggesting it. I dont think she noticed either which wasn't actually surprising because she's not very perceptive. Anyway, hope my ramble at least made some sense, just want help on how to go about this at all and wonder if I should just forget about it or talk it over with. Thanks again!

I've been on two (official) dates with this girl. From the very start she seemed into playing the game a little, meaning she wants to appear unavailable (let's call it hard-to-get). I haven't let this bother me a lot, because she seemed really into me during the dates, asking a lot of questions/even casually mentioning future plans for dates with me etc. She also is receptive to anything I do physically and she seemed to enjoy it. In our texting communication, she's so far took quite long to respond to every message I sent (it was always within 24hrs, though). We also never sent a message more than once a day. However, trying to setup our third date now. I texted her saying I wanted to meet somewhere next week. She replied saying she's booked full that week, and counteroffered a day in the week after it. However, I've replied saying that day won't work for me and proposed two alternatives. Haven't heard anything for 2-3 days now. Now, I'm well aware that she probably wasn't booked full at all and simply wanted to seem busy, whatever. I've gotten used to some game playing. In fact, if she hadn't counteroffered, I would've given up on this girl on the spot. The counteroffer seems to imply she's still interested, but her lack of response after it is a bit confusing, because it implies that she wants nothing to do with me anymore. Am I interpreting this situation correctly? Frankly, this is THE most hard to get girl I've had to deal with. Bar some very subtle signals from her, any sort of escalation or progression of this thing has been entirely up to me. The only thing she has initiated is actually our first conversation in a bar. I'd appreciate any sort of input on this situation. I know you are not mindreaders, but I figured some outside perspective might be useful. Also, I should mention that I'm dutch and she's american.

He actually hooked up with someone an hour after the breakup, after making the decision that due to fighting too much we should have some time apart. The fighting had been going on for months, resulting in physical and verbal abuse We'd had sex twice the night of the breakup so I'm assuming he did it for emotional comfort or something along those lines rather than for the sexual purpose of it. Me thinking it was never going to work out again (despite being under the impression he is the one) slept with someone last night Today we had a discussion about working things out, so obviously I told him about what I did. Extreme verbal abuse ensued - he feels betrayed I get it. I need to know if it is even possible that we can come back from this. I want to be with him even though everything has been a mess lately. He's given me three conditions: 1. I am never allowed to drink again 2. I must completely cut the guy I slept with out from my life; and 3. He is going to fuck someone else, for a reason I can't fathom nor could he explain. Are these conditions reasonable? Have I ruined it forever? Has anyone experienced something similar and had it work in their favour? If yes, how? What was the process, how long did it take, was it as difficult as I'm assuming it would be?

I'm a 22 male and my girlfriend just left me a few days ago, and I'm completely lost right now. She gave me the absolute best months of my life, we connected on ways that I didn't even know were possible, I gave her 100% of me every single day. I never stopped giving a full effort. I gave her everything and now she's taking it with her. To explain: Last week, her mother died and she was taking it hard, as is understandable. Her family lives in another city, so she went to be with them for a week, stops communicating with me almost entirely, and a week later texts me that she's picking up her things from our place and moving back with her family, and that she can't balance me and everything else. She said ""nothing could have ever taken me from you, except this week."" I just don't understand this at all. What the hell am I suppose to do now? Why won't this pain end? How can I cope when I can't sleep because thoughts of her flood my mind? How can I cope when everything reminds me of her and causes intense pain. I've gone through far worse things than a break up. I've been with people longer and broke up. But I've never felt pain like this in my life, and I just can't understand any of this at all.

Okay. I posted this in askreddit and they told me to post it here. I don't know if it belongs as I've never posted or really visited here on my regular account. If it is not allowed than please delete it. So. My girlfriend and I were hanging out last night talking about sex and stuff and she told me that she wants to put a picture up on gonewild. I didn't think she was serious until tonight when she texted me ""If I sent you a picture of my tits, would you put them on gonewild for me?"" This here shows that she isn't hiding anything from me. But I still feel weird knowing a ton of guys and girls will be seeing her naked and commenting on it. How would you react if your Girlfriend/Boyfriend(don't see much of them on gw) wanted to put pictures up online? In a way I think its really hot but in another way it kinda weirds me out. For guys who have had their girlfriends/wives put pictures on gonewild, how has it effected/affected (tired and this has always confused me) your relationship? Has it been for the better or made things weird? I asked about doing gwcouples and she is too shy for that right now but she said maybe in the future.

So, this is something I have been afraid to deal with when it came to a new relationship. My last boyfriend and I had an amazing time together, but we both ultimately realized we were better off as friends than being together. I don't have any romantic feelings for him anymore, but I do love him as a friend. He is incredibly supportive and we gel really well. I have, in the past, tried to approach the topic with a romantic interest only to have them get very judgmental about it. I recently met a new guy who I talk to every day, we've been on dates, and we have both expressed a desire to try this out. I also really don't want to cut off my ex-boyfriend as a friend because he has helped me through a lot and, although we dated, I think of him more as a friend. To cut to the point, I have not been able to successfully broach the subject with a couple romantic interests in the past and I really like this new guy. He is everything I had hoped for, but I feel like he is going to judge me/feel intimidated by the fact that one of my best friends also happens to be an ex. How can I try bringing it up in a way that won't make the new romantic interest comfortable with this? I really don't want to scare him off.

Should I [23/F] be at all concerned if my bf [22/M] of 5 yrs is ""stalking"" other women on facebook/twitter/instagram on a daily basis? All of the women are people he has met or seen around his college campus. There are a few women in particular that he keeps tabs on closely, sometimes several times a day. Let's just say, he knows exactly which albums to go to for swimsuit pictures. To my knowledge, he has made no attempt to further contact with these women. Gentleman...I need to know..is this behavior normal for a guy in a longterm relationship!? I cannot begin to understand what he gets out of doing this..especially since I've been the horny one/one to initiate sex lately. According to his browser history, it should be the other way around.

I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 months now. He's great! He's kind, funny, hot, etc. I will note he's fairly quiet and reserved, I think his parents somewhat helicopter parented him into getting an athletic scholarship at our school, but it's been fun getting him to open up a little. I really enjoy our sex life. Anyways, there are a couple of things I want to try in the bedroom. I haven't actually tried any of them before, but I've been thinking about it a lot, and I feel comfortable enough with him to want to try it with him. I don't think it's anything too crazy, I just want to try very light bondage (on him) and be the ""dom"" (just to feel in control or something) and also see if he's willing to ""toss the salad.""

My GF and I are in an open relationship of 1.2 years, I am fine with her sleeping with another guy once a month or so, and preferably someone I know or can track on facebook, get their number from my GF. I also sleep with other women, but not much at all and we have strict rules of always telling one another. My GF went to a high class sex club and ended up fucking 3 guys, blowjobs, handjobs and penetration vaginally. She loved it and wants to go back more often. I feel absolutely crushed, my masculinity hurts, I feel like I'm not good enough, and my value is dropped. I cant protect her from the people at these places if they decided to kidnap her, but when I tell her I want to protect her, she feels insulted that I would consider her dumb enough to get caught or need ""protecting"". I've told her I would like to come to these events when she wants to go (this costs me about $120 each time) but only when she goes so I can grasp some peace of mind. She does not like this idea and calls me trust of her into question. I dont know what to do, is it acceptable to let her go back to these places often and take 3,4,5 or however many cocks in one night while I'm not around to protect her if something goes wrong. She's already been given a card from one of the guys indicating his mansion is available. I feel sick about this, but she told me that she wont be going to it. She got home by getting a lift from one of the guys there, I was filled with fear when she told me this. What if they decided to take her? What do I do? It's killing me.

I have a pretty lax attitude when it comes to lending small amounts of money. If we're going to a drive-thru, or I'm getting gas before we drive somewhere, I'm not gonna ask people for five dollars back here and there. Most of my friends recognize this and don't hold me to standards I won't hold them to. However... ...I have one friend who holds me to every cent. If we get ice cream somewhere and he spots me 3 bucks, he expects to have 3 dollars in his hand the next time he sees me. He straight-up refuses to drive us anywhere because he knows I don't care about gas money, and if he does wind up driving me, he makes sure he gets compensated for it. This has caused situations where we'll hang out one day and I'll spot him a couple dollars for a drink or something, then he'll spot me a couple dollars the next day and expect to be paid back. I know I don't hold anyone else to paying me back either, but it feels like he's taking advantage of me regardless. I don't know what to do about it.

So really long story shortened: met a guy, we started texting (huge long messages, every day got along like a house on fire - a lot fo flirting and genuine conversation), I went away on holiday and we FB messaged the whole time. Come back to town and we're supposed to hang but he gets busy with school, no problem it's okay. But he stops texting back - he'll text me in the morning, apologize for being busy then when I reply, he doesn't text back. I get it.. He's busy. I got the confidence to ask him to hang on Sunday, and he couldn't ""I really wanted to see you but I'm overwhelmed with work"" (that's fine, I told him it was okay and didn't want to be annoying asking to hang when he's busy!) and he said, ""no, I'd much rather be hanging with you :)"" But then I don't hear from him for days. I know he's not only just doing school, because he posted pics of a party he went to on FB. I texted again yesterday just saying hey, hope the week isn't too crazy, and his response, ""this week is crazy. I can't hang out with you before this weekend it's my mom's birthday and we're going away."" Again, no problem, I get he's busy, but I'm really getting the vibe he's shutting me down - I didn't even bother to ask him to hang at that point and he's already saying no. I know I sound like an idiot because he's being upfront about having a lot on... But doesn't this stuff just sort of die a sad death if he's too busy to even bother replying to me or texting me first once in a while? And if it's not important and you really are that busy, then why make it seem like you're SO keen to hang out, but keep finding reasons not to? I guess I just sit on it and give him space for the next couple weeks, but since we haven't even gone on a first date it's like it's over before it even started..

Title is a little exaggerated, but I honestly can't seem to figure this out. Me and my boyfriend have a good sex life when we are together, we have similar libidos and we just have good sex, to be blunt. For the last couple months we've both been away in diff colleges. When we see each other, everything is all good. When we are video chatting, he used to be into seeing me taking off my shirt and teasing him, but for the last week or so he gets annoyed when I do that (""Stop it"" etc). Whenever I tell him how horny I am and how much I miss him he becomes angry because he isn't there for me, instead of horny from the idea of me coming back? I sent him a naked picture this morning to wake him up, and he sent back ""Damn"" and fell asleep... is that normal? I thought guys would usually be pretty awake if their girlfriend sends them a sexy pic. Am I expecting too much of him? Am I reading too much into this?

Hi r/Relationships! Kind of just want to rant..but if anyone else has advice/has been in a similar situation, I'd like to hear your input. Me: 17/F My parents straight up disapprove of my SO of 2+ years, and it's gotten to the point that I just never mention him anymore. They've assumed we've drifted apart since i last mentioned him, but a few days ago they got onto my social networking profiles and figured out otherwise. The thought of him being interested in me repulses them completely, probably because they expect me to ""catch"" a guy with decent looks, class, and ability to obtain a stable high-paying profession in the future. I'm under high pressure to perform well academically and otherwise and that pressure carries over to my social/love life. As for him.. He's extremely thoughtful, not at the top of our class, but still very ambitious. I don't think he's anywhere near the ""scum"" my parents make him out to be. Apparently being associated with this guy in high school means that in college everyone will remember and not date me. Anyways, I was relatively okay with their constantly badmouthing him and guilting me about having liked him until they started stalking my computer accounts because that crosses my line. Before I've been denying all accusations of still harboring feelings for him, but I don't think the denials will hold up anymore since the FB photos and such. Now the problem is how do I talk to them about this and somehow either agree to disagree or compromise on it? Our last conversations on this topic were extremely bitter.

I'll try and make this as quick as possible: (Sorry for the formatting of the post, my mobile phone isn't the greatest so things may be a bit clustered) My fiancé [25 F] has been in a bit of a slump lately. Her mood shifts constantly from happy to sad. We've talked about it and have agreed that if it doesn't improve she should considering speaking with a professional. Now let's fast forward to a few days ago. She was out Christmas shopping and I was home alone. I went on my old laptop that I haven't used in months. She had taken it with her when she visited her mom out of town. I found multiple nudes and selfies with notes with other guys names on them. I confronted her on it. It took me over an hour to get the truth out of her. She told me she was in a bad place at her moms and having other people say nice things about her made her feel better. I'm at a complete loss of what to do. I love this woman, we've been together for two years. A year of that time we've been living together. She has apologized multiple times and has been doing nothing but crying and sitting around. I want to forgive her but I'm just so damn hurt.

I'm not sure this is the right place for this but here goes: Ever since I graduated high school I've started drifting away from my high school friends. I've moved around studying in different countries and travelling. I do still meet up with them from time to time but I can't help feeling like an outsider at this point and honestly I don't enjoy the things we used to do together anymore and hanging out with them just isn't the same anymore and feels a bit forced. This being said they do still want me to hang out with them. They have also mentioned that they don't like it that I'm never around and when I'm back in town and I didn't tell them beforehand I was going to be back they seemed upset that I didn't notify them rather than just being glad I'm back. So to me if feels like clingy behavior and that they are holding on too much to the past we had. I'm not sure what I should do, should I just cut my ties and move on? We've been friends for a very long time (some of them even from as early as kindergarten). They've recently asked me to join them for a skiing trip which looks very awesome but I'm not sure I'll enjoy myself (and whether I should skip the week of classes for it). Overall I feel pressured/smothered. Any advice is welcome.

Yeah as the title says, we were together for two years, I loved her with pretty much every fibre of my being (and still do). We were long distance but I was saving up money to buy a mortgage and move in with her, I managed to save about $25,000 in two years for us. She told me she's fed up with being the only one doing anything to make this a relationship anymore, we're not going anywhere, that I don't have any ambition and that I'm not what she's looking for and she's moved on. She never knew I was saving up all that money, I was going to surprise her this year...I told her but yeah, I guess it was too late, her mind was made up. It's been over a month since I've had any contact with her and I just feel like crap, I keep having dreams about her, dreams that we're back together, I love her so much it's sick. I told her to take the money too as I don't even want it now, just reminds me of a future that will never happen....she refused to take it. I know I should have done more for her, sent her more gifts or shown her that I loved her more....I just wish she'd have given me the chance to do that rather than just ending it after two whole years together. I don't get how she can just be with another man so quickly as well? Within a month she's with another man like I didn't even exist it's just crazy, it's like I meant nothing to her. I feel like an ugly cretin, self-confidence and esteem is completely destroyed. Don't know what to do anymore.

Hi! So like the title says, I'm a lady in my early 30s feeling a bit stuck in life. On the professional side of things - I worked hard through high school/college/grad school to get to my dream job - found that I was absolutely loving it, but that it was wayyy more intense than I had expected. After doing the Dream Job for a few years, I realized I was gaining weight (not ideal), had a major health scare (all's good now, but it was scary) and always stressed out, and generally had less time for any personal interests / relationships. I changed jobs about 6 months ago to a job that is less exciting but also way less stressful. I've already noticed that I'm doing better health-wise and am much less stressed - yay! I'm pretty lucky that I was able to make this kind of a transition. (I deliberately sought out something that was a less aggressive role to allow myself time to get better healthwise.) On the personal side - this is where it gets murky. I would love to meet that ""special someone"" and build a great relationship that leads to marriage/kids/etc. That said, I've been trying online dating for a few months now and have had a few really random short-ish relationships but nothing is sticking. I'm getting increasingly frustrated and worried that I won't find the right person. I've spent some time over the past few weekends with friends I've had for a while - and it just hit me that they are all married, buying homes, having babies. I'm really excited for them but can't help but wonder when it will be my turn. It's frustrating to me because unlike something like a job or school, this isn't something I can make an aggressive project plan and just go after it. And so I have no idea how to think through this. I'd love any advice - how do I feel unstuck/less like I'm left behind? How do I give myself the space to try meeting people/building relationships without constantly wondering ""is he the One?"" Thanks in advance!

For me, the notion that a woman could be physically attracted to me - particularly someone who I also happen to find attractive - is literally inconceivable. If I try to imagine possible scenarios where I'm asking a woman out, it is impossible for me to envision any in which she accepts my offer. I've seen all manner of guys get into relationships: fat, skinny, unkempt, you name it. Other people with even greater setbacks in their lives are fully capable of it. Why do I feel like I'm too ugly or too socially awkward to be worthy of anybody's interest? Even going beyond this initial barrier, let's say that I ask a woman out, and she actually says yes. What's going to happen when she finds out that I'm on permanent disability for severe depression and social anxiety ($1500/month), or that I don't even have a driver's license, let alone a car? I'm not very adventurous, and I spend a lot of time at home. What do I have going for me that other guys don't?

My ('half')sisters live in Europe with my mom and their dad. I see them once every two years or so. I have tried sending gifts twice. One time I didn't have money at the last moment, and the other time the gift simply never arrived (fuck you to a certain tween merchandise storechain at the mall). So recently the husband and I bought some dirt cheap tablets online(50 dollars each). One of my sisters really wants a smartphone and recently bought one after years of saving up money, only for it to not work properly. My parents don't have a lot of money, but they give us what they can. I've been wanting to send my siblings two tablets for Christmas, or really just for the whole family to use if they want. They can use it for homework, music, Netflix etc. It's just that I feel like it'd be bad to send those things over without a head's up. My parents might think that they are more expensive than they are, and they refuse to ever accept financial help from me. If I were to ask my mom I'd phrase it as 'I came across these cheap-ass tablets, I don't think they ship to Europe. Can I send some to *siblings* for Christmas?'. But the last two times I tried tl send gifts they never arrived, and I had asked for my mom's input about what I should get. I feel like I'd just be some deadbeat if I told her 'hey I'm sending you shit' again, and maybe she'll just think it's an empty promise. What should I do? Btw they're not supercontrolling parents who get offended if their kids have something nice, I just worry that they'll think it's expensive and too much.

Me 20f, him 19m, dating 1 month, friends with serious sexual tension 1 year. We know each other better than anyone else in the world and are seriously in love. However, since we've been officially together, and the lovey-dovey texts have started, I've been bothered by how he goes about this relationship. His ex was extremely high-maintenance, gave him the silent treatment often, dumped him over trivial shit 12 times in 3 years, basically was immature and treated him like shit. I'm going to speculate here and say that she believed in the Disney ""a man should treat me like a princess"" etc etc bullshit, and she whipped him into shape. To me, it all seems very high school, and I think, since that was his only real relationship, he now accepts that that's just how relationships go. Now I'm a firm believer that two people in a relationship are still two people and need lives outside of each other. He doesn't seem to be able to take cues when I want to stop texting because I'm *doing something else*, for example, driving. I worry that he gets upset. Also, if I don't reply, he'll send a panic message: ""are you okay?"" This is further evidence to me that his previous relationship was 24/7 contact and 10 minutes apart meant something was wrong. I don't really know how to say to him that I find all this unnecessary without making it sound like I don't love him as much as he loves me. I definitely do, I just show it in a different way. Am I being cruel for wanting him to change, or repress some of his feelings because it makes me a bit uncomfortable? How can we work out a compromise?

I met my girlfriend in a play we were doing together in 2014, where I played her romantic interest (cue alarm bells). We hit it off pretty quickly, and before the show was over, we were going steady. We've always been really comfortable with each other and our sex life is great, even though we both admit that we're totally different. Recently though, those differences have been niggling at me. Although we rarely argue, we also rarely agree on anything. At its core, our basic world views are vastly different. At first, I put it down to opposites attract, but more and more, I find it's putting up a wall between us. I know there was a time I really loved her, but the more I think about it, the less I think I feel that way. All this has come to a head, because we had THAT conversation a few days ago. The one about the future, and where we are going. Basically, I don't want what she wants (a house close to her parents, white picket fence etc). I told her that, but the next day we acted like the conversation didn't happen. Now the niggling, has become a huge problem in my mind, the comfort is gone, and I'm really starting to believe I don't love her anymore. Should I tell her how I feel, and perhaps break-up, or wait a little bit to see if this is just cold feet? Whatever the case, I care about her immensely, and though I know she isn't fragile, I don't want to hurt her, especially when she's going into final exams.

During the weekend, I usually visit my girlfriend (21) whom lives about an hour away. We've been dating for 4 months now, and have plans to move in together come April. I haven't seen my friend in two weeks. We had plans to hang out a week ago, but he had to cancel as family plans came up. Friday he asked me if I want to go to the bar. I let him know I'm spending the weekend with my girlfriend in another city. He didn't like this answer, and replied with ""Guess I'm never gonna see you during school. Not even going to argue this cause it's pointless, nothing is going to change. Done trying."" I texted back the following day telling him I want to have him & some mutual friends over on the weekend since it's been a while - no reply. Yesterday, I texted him saying ""Not sure if you're still pissed or what, but I've got some time to hang out today if you're free. I've been busy with school and such but you're definitely right, we haven't hungout for nearly two weeks and that's on me."" - no reply. I haven't texted him since, and don't plan to. I've been busy maintaining a good GPA & spending weekends with my girlfriend, as that's the only time I get to see her. Am I being an ass without realizing it? Where should I go from here?

I've been single for five months now and I am comfortable with the idea of not having her in my life; in fact, I welcome it and can't wait to go to college next year where I won't have to see her again. Yet I still feel jealous at the thought of those two together. The fact is, I always knew she had feelings for him; he was her first crush in high school and even during our relationship she would often talk about him. What's worse is that he's actually a friend of mine...we're not very close but still close enough that it would be inappropriate to date my ex. I've lost all my respect for him. It just hurts knowing that they will be together next year most likely...I was always afraid she would leave me for him during our relationship. Maybe that was why she broke up in the first place but it doesn't matter. Last night I became so consumed in my desire to find out for sure that I went on my ex's twitter and his twitter to look for any ""signs""...I even considered hacking their facebook accounts to check their messages but didn't go through with it after I figured out how pathetic I was being. But this is ridiculous now...I can't help but want to know for sure if they are dating...it's as if knowing that will somehow make me feel better but I know I will feel like shit after I find out one day. What's wrong with me guys? I was never like this before...and I never thought I'd stalk people's tweets like that...I'm feeling like shit. Someone please help me sort this out somehow.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 18 months. Last night it was my friends birthday. After the party my boyfriend and I left and on our way home we stopped by a souvlaki place. As we were leaving, this guy slapped my ass. My boyfriend pushed him. They got closer and started talking crap to one another before I grabbed him and told him to forget it. Anyway, while we were driving home I told him that I didn't think he could have beaten the guy in a fight. I didn't say it out of the blue obviously, it came up in conversation. My boyfriend and I are short, I'm 4'10 and he's 5'4 the other guy was around 6'4. My boyfriend used to do moy Thai and he works out a lot, but the other guy had a foot on him and he was probably 50lb+ heavier. I think he's mostly angry because I laughed at him when he said he could have beaten him. Which I admit was a butch thing to do. As it stands he's pretty angry at me. I'm sure that it will blow over. (At least I hope so.) But in the future am I just supposed to lie? Is that what a good girlfriend does? ""Oh you could totally beat up guys who are more than a foot taller than you and have a significant weight advantage."" Am I supposed to lie now to make him feel better? I think it's a little silly for him to expect me to think that he can defy the laws of physics. After the party he dropped me off but didn't sleep over or anything. I think he's just punishing me. Am I in the wrong here?

I'm having trouble keep it up in bed. Me and my girlfriend have done it tons before. At the start of our relationship I was a virgin and she was not and I had trouble keeping it up when we were going to have sex. Eventually we did it and we had been having sex ever since. Recently i have been having trouble getting it up. It's been about a month that I've been having problems... at first it was that I was really sensitive down there sometimes and I would finish almost right away. Now it's gotten to the point where when we are about to do it I lose it but only when I go to get on top. We've managed to do it when she's on top and then I can roll her over and be on top and I'm fine, but it's just starting on top that I can't maintain it. I get really nervous and my heart is beating so fast. I think it's because she's expecting me to make her orgasm every time although she said she isn't.

Last night, my married childhood friend(26M I will call him Jay) of 15 years and I went to grab a few drinks while my fiance(25f) and her soon to be married friend(25f) stayed home at my house. Jay had tried to sleep with my fiance's friend at a previous houseparty we had. Jay was shut down that night, but is persistent in his pursuits when he sees this girl again. Upon returning last night, the four of us stayed up talking/hanging out. Around 2 am, my fiance and I went upstairs for bed, and Jay and my fiance's friend hung out for a little longer. Fiance' friend was to stay the night, Jay was to leave to go home to wife and kids. I get a call at 3:00 am from Jay saying he just had sex with fiance's friend, and wanted me to make sure his condom wrapper was cleaned up. I double checked and it was sitting in the garbage. He wanted me to keep in quiet, but I feel like I have to say something. I don't want to hid this from my fiance, but I don't want her to lose her best friend even if she sleeps around 4 months before her wedding day. What should I do?

Ok, bit of a story but I'll try to be as brief as I can. I have been married since 2009. We have been dating since 2007. I have been cheating almost all of those years. I was sent to Korea as a miltary duty station and ended up getting a girl pregnant. My wife found out and now she knows everything. For whatever reason, she wants to stay with me. (that sounds bad but you know what I mean. I don't deserve her). I want to be able to start building trust again. I know it will take time but I find that she gets mad at me for little things and she tells me that she doesn't think I am trying. What can I do to get her to begin to trust me again?

I'm 22m, she is 20f. Dating for 8 months, ish. Last weekend I cheated on my girlfriend. I was blacked out drunk (so much so that I missed a plane the next day). No sex, but it's about the promise breaking, not the act itself. Here's the catch(es). 1. It isn't the first time this has happened. I thought I was over this. I don't know what causes it (besides being shitfaced) and I don't know how to stop it (besides never touching alcohol again. Haven't since it happened. Might be the move here folks.) I know it'll be easy to throw harsh words at me. Feel free. But if there is anyone out there who has felt like a hostage of their own stupidity when drunk and learned to wrangle with that, how, how, tell me how. 2. I love this girl. I feel like she's the first person in my life who has ever truly respected me, who thought I was cool. We mesh on just every single level there ever was, and I really enjoy it. We have a storybook romance that started overseas and I don't want it to end with me disappointing her. Here is where I want some outside input. I'm not telling anyone in my real life this time. I want to hear though. Am I a really bad person? Am I obligated to tell my girlfriend? If I don't and she ends up moving to live with me across the country, should I break it to her before then? Something in me feels like a capitan needs to fuckin sink with his ship. Telling her would provide me my moral vindication at the expense of her self worth and happiness. Of course, maybe these are only things I've convinced myself of in order to make the cowardly choice of not telling. How do I stop? What is the right thing to do? Please help.

Met boy, dated for 4 months....questioned our chemistry from the get-go but we had a ton of common interests, values, likes/dislikes, I thought we could build something. We did, but I never felt that want to rip your clothes off can't wait to see you excitement with him, although I geninely enjoyed his company. Long story short, our career/financial status/goals are vastly different. He works in a job that could not be considered a career. I'm well established in my career and make twice as much money as him, I recently bought a house, he lives in a friend's basement for dirt cheap. I came to realize being with him would mean basically supporting both of us on my salary, along with any children we may have, giving up vacations, retirement account, savings, etc. It would be an incredibly tight life. He has expressed he wants to make more but in the time we were together I saw him take zero action on that (applying for jobs, school, etc) He NEVER mooched off of me or asked me for money. But I came to realize our ambition levels/financial comfort zones were very different. I'm 29, want a family in the next few years. I would have had to wait who knows how long to get his life togethers. When I tell people this, they think I'm a complete superficial bitch. I disagree and tell them being at different places career wise/financial wise can really create resentment between partners and I would have to sacrafic literally everything I enjoy for a future with him. I also believe strongly in gender roles that the man should be somewhat of a provider, or at the very least meet me half way. I am more than willing to be the caretaker, cooker, cleaners, etc. Am I superficial or is this a real concern?

About 2 years ago, my ex and I broke up because we were arguing a lot and just weren't seeing eye to eye anymore. However, for the year following we continued to meet up and have sex when we were drunk. Now, here I am, 2 years later and I still can't stop thinking about her. Any mention of her name and I can't get her out of my head for days. I've found it pretty impossible to get close to anyone since then - I've had quite a lot of one night stands since then and have been casually dating other girls... but every time things begin to get serious, I just can't stop thinking about her and I end up just ruining things. It's not even like she was a particularly good girlfriend, she wasn't my first love and I'm pretty sure she was sleeping with other people. I've even deleted her off facebook and unfollowed her on twitter - we haven't spoke in months except from once on the bus. No matter what I do, I just can't stop thinking about her. I'm getting pretty desperate her, reddit, I just need some solid advice.

My ex bf of a year and a half and I have had issues for a while. We've been fighting a lot and have developed rather unhealthy behaviors during these fights. I feel like both of us have adopted this fight-or-flight response that has made otherwise silly fights turn into something more ugly and damaging. After getting in a huge fight last week, my boyfriend begged for me back. Twice. I didn't know what I wanted and felt pressured to have an answer right away so I took him back, twice, and ended up changing my mind again. I realized a day or two later that I was wrong and tried to mend things but it was too late. He decided we were better off apart for now (I'm leaving for 7-8 weeks). He said he hopes we can work on our issues separately and maybe be together again at some point after the summer. I would rather stay together and work on our issues as a couple but kind of understand the merit in being apart for a while also... I just don't want to break up or be with other people. I don't feel like our issues are insurmountable but I don't understand how we can work on them apart from each other.

Ok, so first off, I'm not sure if this belongs here, so if it doesn't, let me know. My girlfriend and I (also 15) have been dating for about a year, and that part has been going very well. She's had a pretty bad situation at home for all of that time, and recently although it hasn't really been getting worse, she's been getting more depressed and anxious. She lives with her father, her parents are divorced. She doesn't have a good relationship with either parent, and that's always been hard for her. So this section is a bit iffy, since even though I ask as much as I can and try to talk about it, she doesn't always tell me the exact details of what's going on. She's recently started to have (what sounds like) pretty severe panic attacks more and more often, and her father, who has recently discontinued her therapy sessions for no apparent reason, has gone against her doctor's wishes of getting her a psychiatrist (she might need medication, which can only be prescribed by a psychiatrist), also for no apparent reason. Her grades are dropping and I know I shouldn't be her only lifeline, but I really have no idea what I should be doing or what she should do about any of this. The really hard part is that I only see her on the weekends because we go to different schools, so it's hard to know when she is ok and when she isn't, and when we do see eachother there isn't enough time to talk about everything. I suggested she should talk to her counselor about grades and everything else, and I think she'll do that. I've talked to my parents about it in the past and they know most of the story, but I haven't talked to them recently about it, but I'm not sure if I should. I really want her to be ok, and if you guys have any suggestions at all, I want to hear them.

I was in a long-term relationship (8 years with 26/M) that ended in February (although things started cooling off in November 2013). Okay, shitty, but that's life sometimes. I moved out on my own into a great apartment, took the dog with me, adopted a cat. Cool. People have been telling me I shouldn't jump into another relationship quickly, and to some extent I agree- but the reality of it is, I'm so fucking bored I can't stand being single. And it's not like I just sit around moping either. I have a full-time job, read a lot, play video games, walk the dog, ride my bike, go to the library, go running every day, keep a journal, keep my apartment clean, have a decent amount of friends, watch football games with a group of people every week, occasionally go to the bars, etc. But I want someone to *share that shit with*. For the first time in my life I have a decent paying job and enough spare time to go out and do the things I want to do. I'm not looking for my future husband or anything serious right now (I recognize it's still too soon post-breakup for that), but I'd like *some* kind of connection with a guy. I had a FWB for about two months, but then one day he freaked out and told me that things were getting too intimate and he didn't want a relationship (but also that he couldn't just do no-consequence sex and it made him feel shitty... wat) and completely stopped talking to me. So, that didn't work out for me either and it made me feel terrible, to boot. I just feel lost. Because it feels like I have a full life, but at night when I'm winding down for the day, I just feel so fucking bummed out and alone. One of my older coworkers said you need to feel at peace by yourself being single, but I don't know what else to do to get to that point.

I dated my wife for 7 years, married for 3 years (total of 10 now). I love my wife and have loved her the entire time. Initially our sex life was exciting, kinky, and we tried new things all the time. For quite some time now it has turned extremely repetitive. I don't know if that's part of the problem or not. Part of my issue is that I'm not really physically attracted to her anymore. She has been overweight our entire relationship and at first I didn't mind. Now it has become a major annoyance for me. I feel like I resent her for not trying harder to lose the weight. Part of the issue is we can't have children, partially due to her weight issues. She struggles with her own issues of self image due to the weight issue and I think that is hurting my attraction to her too. She doesn't feel sexy or attractive and so doesn't try as hard. I've thought about cheating, but the thought isn't interesting to me. I love my wife and I love being with her. She is my best friend and I have tons of fun with her. I can't imagine my life without her. I also feel guilty all the time for not being interested in her more physically. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for. I've been super stressed lately and don't really have anyone I feel comfortable talking about this with. I just need to get this out and hear others' thoughts I guess.

I met him on a popular dating site and we've been talking constantly for about almost 9 months non-stop now. We agreed that we'll be there for each other always, but I've always had feelings for him since the very beginning and he acknowledged it. When we talk it's usually about his troubles with dating sites in general...you know, not a lot of women would talk to him. He's amazing but not a lot of people can see that. But the last 2 weeks he's been absent more or less. I have to initiate everything, and all I get is lukewarm reception (HOURS later). He did say something about talking to someone closer to him, but reassured me that I remain his only best friend. I'm incredibly jealous and blind with rage. I don't know why, because I know it's incredibly unfair to expect him to have feelings for me. But I hate it so much. He doesn't talk to me so much anymore. He said that he'd never abandon a friend for anyone, but I guess those are exaggerations. We used to play Facebook games but my invite has been ignored for more than two weeks now. People of reddit, what should I do? Stop initiating conversation? I'm hoping that all these are just my imaginations...or my hormones fucking me up from the inside.

So I accidentally found out from one of our mutual friends that my GF got really drunk on NYE and kissed 3 strangers. This was when we were still talking online, but we had a first date planned for a few days after. I am still bothered by this, and we've kinda discussed this, but I still have some obsessive thoughts here and there that aren't good. Obviously, this wasn't something she ever planned to tell me, but I can't change that now. I guess I am bothered that right before our date she drunkenly was kissing strangers. We've been together for over a year now and I love her to death, but sometimes I get these unwanted mental images in my head of this night that she barely remembers. She clearly didn't do anything wrong, as we hadn't even met face to face yet, but does anyone have any advice for easing these bad thoughts?

I used to be a webcam model when I was aged 20-22. I used the money to pay for college to get an Associate's degree in art. From ages 23 to 26 I was a sex worker. I worked for a well-known company that releases porn movies. I never made movies of the kind that were released on DVD or streamed on the internet, but would often be sent to private parties to either strip or have actual sex with wealthy clients. I did a lot of hard drugs. After that I got my act together and these days I manage a vintage art and clothing shop with a friend. I'm not rich, but I've got my own apartment and car and am taking care of myself. I am absolutely sober. My days of coke, X, K, and other stuff are over. A few months ago I met this really cute, younger guy who would sometimes come into our shop to buy shirts and things. One day we got to talking, one thing led to another, and it was actually me asking him out. He's really a clean cut, decent guy who has always been a total gentleman with me. He's got his college degree in business and works for a law firm in the PR department. We have so many of the same tastes in music, art, film, television... everything. The sex is amazing, which surprised me considering he's so young and shy. He's already making nice noise about introducing me to his mother and father. My own parents are split up and I don't have a relationship with either of them. Here's my issue though. I really think I'm falling in love with him, and I know he ought to know about my past, but I'm scared to tell him because he might flip out and dump me. It's happened before. Should I tell him? Does he have a right to know? It all happened a long time ago, I've been tested, and don't have any STDs. Thanks for your help Reddit.

19M here..the full story is this. I have known who this girl (20) is for about a year now, but I just met her earlier this summer. She is a sister of one of my best friend's friend. We met when me, my friend, her brother, and others went to a lake house for a weekend for drinking and what not. By the time the weekend was over I had gotten her number (I actually wasn't really interested at this point)... but we started texting constantly for the next few weeks and I eventually started to really like her. I was too afraid to ask her out, because my good friend (best really) has known her and her brother for years and I was decent friends with her brother. I figured it'd just be weird so I never made a move. Fast forward to about two weeks ago, she drunk texts me saying she has a crush on me, so I ask her out. Our date went well and I know she's really into me. She says we should have been hanging out all summer, etc etc... Well now I'm leaving tomorrow for college (2nd year) about 9 hours away. What should I do? I really like her and I know she likes me, but I'm going to be away till November (we're actually going to a concert in another city in November).. I want to go on more dates with her, are my only options really just to wait? I have never been in a serious relationship, but I definitely know there is something here. :/

They went out for about a year and a half and stopped dating about 4 months before seeing me. They broke up because he wasn't ""ready"" for a serious relationship. I saw the first text since we were googling stuff on her phone but since then shes been very protective with her phone... making sure to take it to the bathroom, napping with it under her pillow, etc. I'm scared that he is trying to convince her to get back with him. Considering they have a long history, I'm pretty scared he will succeed. She seems to be really into me but at the same time she is super vague when I ask about him. Am I being paranoid?

Alright I'm really confused with my situation. There is a girl that I've known since middle school and when we first met we started out as acquaintances. During 8th grade I'd see her I. The halls a lot and would always playfully joke around with her because we were friends. I then found out at the end of the year she had a massive crush on me and was peer pressured by friends into talking to her. So that whole summer we talked and hung out a couple times, but since I was forced into it I was kind of a dick to her and I still wanted to be friends with her so I didn't try to end it or anything. We basically did nothing though and she was the worst and most boring texter anyway. Once high school started we were still talking and kind of a ""thing"" but it was awkward between us. She asked me to a school dance really early so I told her we should wait till it comes a little closer cause who knows what might happen. She took that wrong and proceeded to start freaking out ending our thing. We still managed to be friends and ""talk"" to each other every once and awhile. This year though she changed a lot and even got fucked by some scum from my school. Most people in the school don't see her the same way, even me, but when I still have the same feelings for her after this despite what my friends say about her. I don't know what I should do whether to stay friends with her, stop talking to her or try to pursue the crush I have with her. (I have not been friendzoned.)

I admitted to it all and we talked it out and I was more upset about how he hooked up with some other girl right before we started dating (because we were hooking up for about 2 months and he KNEW I had assumed we were exclusive and he just never corrected me) and didn't really care about the sexting. But I recently found out he kept talking to the sext girl for about a month after the sext incident. He told me he essentially deleted her from his life after it happened because she was stupid and he didn't reciprocate any feelings. But he continued flirting with her over text, email etc. and I can only assume nothing physical happened, but how can I assume that when he never told me about the other stuff. Other than this, he has been an extremely wonderful, loving, supportive, communicative boyfriend. But he's always been a self-destructive type and I want to trust him 100% but I've always had this looming expectation that he'll cheat on me or something because he used to have issues with depression, and I think he expects himself to fuck everything up so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Should probably mention, he hooked up with her about 7 months before we started dating. I've never met her. I'm pretty sure the scratch-mark scars on his hips are from her and it bothers me so much to see them when he has his shirt off. I feel a little betrayed. Should I bring this up non-directly? Just ask ""you've never cheated on me, right?"" or something. I don't know what to do to give myself closure.

Hi Reddit, a bit stumped on what to do here, appreciate any advice. :) My aunt got married in April, 2007 to this really great guy who had two daughters from his previous marriage. Over the next 5 years I became relatively close to the older cousin to the point where I considered her one of my best friends. I guess something went wrong in my aunt's marriage, and one day my then uncle told her he wanted a divorce ""out of nowhere"". Things got bad really quickly between my side of the family and my cousin's side of the family. (Apparently a lot of spying and some really bad accusations against the ex-husband, none of which I'll ever be sure are true or not) So I never got to talk to my cousin again; she was never allowed on social media and didn't have a phone at the time so I had no realistic way of contacting her. Recently though I decided to search her name on Facebook and she actually came up. I really want to get in touch with her again, however I'm very concerned about how our families would react if they found out we were friends. I don't want to bring up bad memories for my aunt or cause more drama, but at the same time I feel it's unfair for two friends to never be able to talk again because of their families being petty. It's not romantic in any way, but there's a lot of bad blood here and it has been a pretty long time. Thanks for any help.

So there was this girl. I wasn't really interested in her at first, and was concerned about the fact that we work together, but she kept pursuing, and eventually really made me fall for her. Then she texted (!) me one night and told me she was uncomfortable with working and dating and we should probably just stay friends, clearly a bold-faced lie, because she got back with her ex that night. :( This all clearly left me feeling pretty shitty, like I was nothing but a self-esteem booster for her, and seeing her around our workplace doesn't help. I thought she was really funny and amazing before, but now I can't see her as I did before she did all that shit to me. However, we still have to interact sometimes for work. Should I try to explain how I feel in order to have closure and move on? Or should I just ask her to hang out and clear the air, and not mention any of what happened so we can be acquaintances again without the palpable awkwardness whenever our paths cross? I've already learned my lesson about dating coworkers, so please no lectures about that! Thanks. :)

So about 6 months ago, both me and my girlfriend got extremely drunk. We came home and had sex, and while having sex I called her one of her friends names. What makes this even worse is one day prior to going out with my GF, when I had a lot of feelings for her, she asked me who I liked and I panicked and said her friend, due to her having strong feelings for another guy at this time. I have no sexual feelings towards this girl, and haven't thought about her sexually and was certainly not thinking about her that night, it was simply a slip of the tongue. I haven't seen this girl in a while and at a party the other night, she kissed me on the cheek when saying goodbye. My GF is extremely sensitive about this type of stuff, due to her mother cheating on her dad. She brought it up last night that she thinks about that night a lot and that she can't shake it. I have no idea where to go from here, no matter what I say, I can't take away from the fact that I called out her name, regardless of whether it meant something or not. Advice please!

I have been divorced for 2.5 years, my girlfriend for 14 years. I met her shortly after my divorce was final. Just fell into it. My kids are still under 18. Hers are all adult, with the youngest being a HS graduate 18 living at home. Her ex passed away 9 years ago and it has caused issues of course for the younger 2 of her kids. We have a great time together being active, etc. However, I can't really even go to her house when he is there. He does not like that his mother is dating and in the past he has done things like break drywall. She indulges him and admits to me that she goes overboard because of what happened with her ex passing away. He recently got an OWI and she is all full of angst and depressed about it. Her response is to give him rides to work, etc. She will probably foot the bill for his lawyer too. My instincts are telling me that this will always be a problem and I should consider moving on. Its hard because I like her a lot, but its hard to see a future for us together. We both agree we want to go slow and are in no hurry to marry or move in together. My kids have no issue with me dating and she has been over with them many times. My ex and I have a civil relationship. Am I being hasty? Or do you feel that this will never end with her son? I guess I have been hoping he will grow up and move along. When I was 18 I didn't really care what my parents were doing. Am I being naive?

My wife (43) has stopped doing anything. She doesn't work. She doesn't do any thing with the kids. She doesn't doe anything around the house (i.e. home-maker stuff). She literally sits in bed 23.5 hours a day watching tv. She doesn't eat with us - or at all for that matter. She doesn't talk to us. She drinks, but minds her own business. How can i get her to leave? We have been married for 17 years. I'm 41. Depression is a big part of the problem. We have tried therapists, inpatient alcoholism treatment, detox, AA, and doctors. She has ""detached"" from her primary care physician and refuses to select another one within our insurance plan. She refuses to see anyone, do anything, or make any effort at anything. This has been going on for over a year. Both kids acknowledge that this is not normal and prefer not to be home when I'm not there.

I have been with my wife for 5 years married for 2.5. Over the last year or so anytime I even slightly disagree with her or we get in the smallest of arguments she breaks down and starts crying stopping all communication. For example this morning while we were trying to get ready for work, and while she was changing the baby he spit up on her. I ran and grabbed her a wet paper towel so she could wipe it off. Well I guess I should have grabbed a dish towel because the wet paper towel left some bits behind on her clothes. At that point I felt she started talking to me like I was some kind of moron who didn't have enough common sense to offer her a regular towel. I was admittedly annoyed and let her know she didn't have to treat me like I'm asshole when all I was trying to do was help. There was no yelling or screaming from me or anything of that sort, but she just started crying hysterically after I said that. This is just one example but it is the same thing anytime we argue or even disagree. I honestly don't know how to handle it right now. Is there anything I can do to help her stop crying at everything? My compassion tank for dealing with the crying is basically at 0.

I answered that I don't like the thought of her naked body on the internet for everyone to see and how I'm put off by the thought of countless other men masturbating to naked pictures of her. Apparently she didn't even want to participate, but now she's mad at me for not being supportive. It's a matter of principle for her, she says. I would never say that she's not allowed to do it or that I would stand in her way. I just said that I didn't like the idea. Am I being unreasonable and should I just support her?

So my ex and I have been broken up for almost 4 months now and I've been working on getting over her. We were friends before we dated and want to try to remain friends now that our relationship is over, but that is easier said than done. We're both runners, so we've gone on a few runs together and chatted a bit, but the contact has been spotty and not quite like it once was, which was actually making it easier for me to get over her. We have a lot of mutual friends, and two of them were getting married this Saturday and we were both invited to the wedding. The week before she asked me to get dinner with her since we hadn't seen each other in a while, and we got caught up and had a good time. She got a bit choked up when talking about her X-mas gift she got me (baseball tickets) which I thought was odd, but overall it was a nice time and she suggested that a few of us have a ""drunk brunch"" before the ceremony on Saturday since it was a dry wedding. Saturday rolls around and we drink and have a great time at the wedding. Things seem just like old times. We're joking with each other and giving each other crap about things we always would've (plucking my eyebrows, her stealing my chex mix, etc). It was simply a really nice time. The problem is that I can't stop thinking about it now. It reminded me of how great we were together when things were going well and I can't help but wonder whether or not we deserve another shot. I felt like I was moving on, but this is a huge setback. I don't even know if she feels the same way. Was she just trying to be my friend? Does she feel the same way about all this? Would she even be open to giving it another shot? Should I just drop it altogether and keep trying to move on? I'm more than happy to provide details, but wanted to keep the original post somewhat short.

My sister-in-law and I have never been close, especially when I was a teen. She has always wanted a baby, will always volunteer to help out with any baby/children related things and has been ""baby crazy"" ever since I met her about 17 years ago. As a teen, on frequent occasions I would make ""anti-baby"" comments, such as how, no, they're not cute, they're hideous, annoying, disgusting etc. She certainly took offense. She always wanted to get pregnant but my brother is absolutely against it which breaks her heart. (She has let that be very clear.) She also has numerous health problems which affect her fertility. Now I'm an adult; ie. not a jerk. For the past several years I haven't made any ""anti-baby"" comments but when the question arose, I would simply say having children isn't for me...partially because I was never in a good place in life and also because I try to keep personal info away from them as many of them use it against me. I am now pregnant (planned) and am not planning on announcing it until much later; however, I'm worried about when I do. I am not close to my SIL at all, and only see her a couple times a year for holidays. My initial plan was to just wait until the next family gathering (which won't be for quite while) very obviously pregnant and let them find out that way. But I'm afraid she will have a complete mental breakdown as she is very emotional in the first place. Also, I'm sure the news will come as quite a shock and be upsetting since it is coming from me of all people. I just have no idea how to approach this. Help?

Last night my girlfriend came home late and needed to use my laptop for some homework so I let her. I woke up this morning with a note and her not at home saying how she read through all of my messages (which go back to January). The note said that she felt disrespected, hurt and betrayed by me texting a good friend of mine [19F] the day before about how I wanted to try and spend some more time with my friends and how to tell my girlfriend that. I had no ill intentions by texting my friend about this, I just wanted her opinion on what to do/what to say as I have a hard time expressing myself. I talked with her for two hours about it today, she said how she felt like she didn't even know me and that she wasn't sure that she wanted to be in a relationship with someone who kept secrets from her. I didn't say anything about how she read through all of my messages but now as the day goes on, it's beginning to bug me more and more because I feel like my privacy was invaded. I understand her not liking my friends very much but she would get upset or jealous when I wanted to spend some time with my friends instead of her.

A couple months ago I [26M] met a cool guy that I got along well with. We hung out and drank for a while and had a good time. We planned on hanging out again in the future, but didn't really. That was a couple of months ago. Then last night, I ran into him with a girl at this music festival. I was surprised and happy to see him, and after we said hey he introduced me to the girl, saying, ""This is my girlfriend Rebecca."" I introduced myself to Rebecca, and instantly engaged her in conversation because I wanted to be polite and inclusive, and not just shut her out while I was talking to my old friend. The problem was, we clicked immediately and feverishly. We both struck up an awesome conversation, connected, and forgot entirely that he was there. We had a ton in common right off the bat. Eventually, he seemed to break the trend by saying laughingly, yet awkwardly, ""Wow you two are just perfect for each other aren't you?"" It was awkward and neither of us really knew how to respond to that. I told the guy/my friend that we should hang out again and we parted ways. The problem is, now I can't stop thinking about this girl! She's beautiful, fun, and we instantly clicked. If she was just there by herself and wasn't dating my friend, I would have asked her out without hesitation. I couldn't believe they are together because she's super outgoing and funny and friendly, and he's a little more goofy and awkward, but still a really nice guy. But I know there are certain barricades that simply can't be crossed. Are there any good ideas/tips/strategies/advice to keep in mind in a situation like this? Is there anything at all I can do other than just waiting patiently to see how things work out between them? Thanks so much for your responses.

I've been with my girlfriend for about 6 months and every-things seems peachy when we see each person. We don't really get to see each other that much anymore because of break and she's a two hour drive away. When we first started out, we texted each other quite often with cute little handles like ""dear"" and pet names and such and we would talk about our day, what we were thinking, ect But as we got further into the relationship it seems she doesn't really text that much anymore and when she does it's usually just something random or something she's been doing, these are the only times she responds timely to anymore, it doesn't seem like she's all that interested in me anymore. I brought it up to her and she says she still cares about me, and she admits we really don't talk that much outside of school or special occasions. She says she doesn't really know how to act on account of this being her first relationship. Also text were somewhat sent in the between 5 to 30min intervals when we started seeing each other, now I could sometimes literally wait hours until she would text me back when I ask a simple question.

This is something I've been dealing with for years now. Almost every girl I've dated (4 gfs over the past 5 years), initially I am head over heals obsessed with them, until ultimately there is definitely something more (love? That's what we call it anyway). However, I simultaneously have sexual feelings for other woman. I have never acted on these feelings, I am always faithful and try to avoid so much as talking to other girls. I guess I know to a certain extent that this relationship won't last much longer. However, I guess my question to all of you is, will it get better? Will I eventually get to a point where I will be able to maintain a steady relationship and have no desire to be with other woman? I feel like I will inevitably fall into the same pattern over and over. Maybe I just need to be single for a little while and get it out of my system.

I'm divorcing my wife of 2 years and we both want it. We both live with her father since I was laid off a year ago and have since regained employment. He welcomed us in his home so we could save money while both attending school. We are both students who have our own student loan debt and credit card debt. Neither of us are on each others credit cards. She has a car that is not in my name and I have a car that is in her's and my brother's name (he co-signed because of his excellent credit and because of my short work history after being laid off, my wife's part-time job allowed her to sign).

I don't have anywhere to go because of this and I'm trying to figure out what to do with my belongings and bank account. We have $500 in checking right now and about $3000 in savings. I'm kind of afraid she will drain the account before I can do anything. Here's the worst part! My wife had a 2 year old daughter when I married her. I see her as my own and she see's me as her dad.

I explained to her I have paranoia problems before hand and I know I can solve them on my own. I just asked if she could be extra careful with how she worded things because I had this irrational fear she would try to signal that she was cheating on me with a subtle hint or innuendo. OK so what really bothered me was when I said, "" I always think you had sex then you need to wash off the smell and stuff"" and she responded with "" in this case the truth is i was too tired to shower just for hanging out with family"" . I know it is irrational that it meant anything. I just thought the wording made it sound like she had washed off because of sex other times. I get how crazy it is and it doesn't bother me now. What bothers me is how she could have worded it in countless other ways. I specifically told her how I was afraid she was trying to subtly hint that she was cheating. She said that her use of ""In this case"" was to signify that she had not washed this time because of family and not every other time. I believe that is what she meant too. Am I being unreasonable to think used any other phrase other than In this case?

My brother has always been the quiet one in the family. He had a lot of friends growing up, and was loud as a kid, but always sensitive, too. I've always thought that it would be a good idea for him to see a therapist in the short term, especially in the last two years. He always seems a little anxious, and never really has too much to say. Even when directly questioned, it looks like he's nervous, and like it almost hurts to talk to some people. I like to think I've always been a bit closer to him, but I'm not really sure what he thinks of me. He stayed at my house for a week once, and we had conversations, and I can talk to him, but I don't know how close he thinks I am to him. He's very close to my mom, and confides in her a lot. Recently he's started thinking that he's very sick. He'll find something wrong with himself, or think he feels overly tired, and my mom will take him to the doctor, where they don't find anything wrong. He'll be fine for about a month, and then it happens again, and he gets overly worried, to the point where he thinks he might die soon as a result of some undiagnosed illness. I don't think that's very normal, and it sounds like an exaggerated response to his anxiety, or something of the sort. My parents have finally agreed that he needs to see a psychologist / therapist, but they don't know where to take him. I've been doing a little research online today to try and find someone (although, if anyone else has any help with that, it would be wonderful). I want to find a way to frame it to him that makes it sound like a good thing. There's definitely a stigma with treating mental health, and I think if it's not framed right in somebody's head, they'll never open up. I went to therapy of my own volition last year, and it was one of the best things I ever did - and I really want him to have the same experience.

/r/relationships, you've been a great help to me for the last couple of years, and I feel that i've learned a lot about what makes a good relationship. for some reason though, I've lately been feeling like relationships are pointless and ultimately cause a lot more bad than good for people. I see peoples lives been slowly ruined by emotionally unavailable SO's, infidelity and dead bedrooms, etc. I've had a girlfriend (20 f) for the past 8 months or so and it's been great. but being as young as we are i'm constantly hearing people say that we don't know who we are or what we want yet and that relationships during this age are nearly bound to fail. I know that at some point my girlfriend and i will likely break up, one of us will find a job in one city or graduate school in another. maybe one of us will wake up one day and just decide we want something different. I've been thinking about just ending it with her because why would i want to prolong the inevitable and increase the pain we're both bound to feel? It's just starting to feel like there's really no point. I think back on my relationships in the past and realize how much harm they truly caused me, and i imagine any number failed relationships in the future to be just as bad. Why even bother putting yourself out there, making yourself vulnerable, when you already know what the end result will be?

I've never had a relationship before. The other day I had a date and she stayed at my place and the next day we had sex, cuddled and watched a movie. She emphasised many times how fun the date was, and also said the sex was good. She also hinted at future dates and sexual experiences we could have. She's an avid texter and is into social networking. I emphasised often my lack of enthusiasm and worry I have in texting. This leads to her not texting me, and for some reason I'm worried :s even though that's what I asked for. We arranged our next meet up as 'soon' and said we'd call each other. Now considering everything that went well I'm still worried that I won't get called back... I've never been in a relationship and I get really emotionally attached early which has scared girls away in the past, this is to be avoided at all costs but I can feel it coming, now I'm scared to make another move on fear of giving that impression. I used to be that hopeless guy who would fall in love before anything really happened. How soon should I call her to arrange a date? Or should I rest assured that she'll call me? I want a meet up and I have some ideas on what we can do, so should I just call? I'm also worried that she'll lose interest because she's not avidly texting me like she is other people. Is she just respecting my boundary? Should I be worried of anything? I keep thinking she's gunna forget me. Its not that its painful its more that I really want something to happen this time. I'm worried, despite everything we've done, which isn't much, but more than I've done with most previous girls.

We ended last august and was on/off for a year until he met his current gf. It makes me uncomfortable when I see pictures of him wearing a couple bracelet I've given him (while he is happy with his new gf). He is no longer my friend on Facebook but we have a lot of mutual friends. Should I confront him? I know it doesn't mean anything to him but it still bothers me a lot. I can't be unsubscribing to our mutual friends because of this. I could however, be strong and not care about it. This urge of mine may be due to me wanting to talk to him though. We have a long history of picking fights with each other. I know I will feel a LOT better if I tell him off, but it could also be unnecessary..

It was 11 pm and I kept trying to call her. It was unlike her to not answer the phone or let me know when she'll be home from class. She texted saying ""i don't want to fight"" and when she got home, I woke up around 2 am and realized she was sleeping on the couch. She said she didn't to bother me but i knew something was up. ""I don't want to marry you"" is the first thing she really says to me. I feel completely blindsided. We were highschool sweethearts and she said on multiple occasions that she wanted to spend her life with me, grow old together, have kids, etc. We were supposed to be getting married in 3 months and she had her dress picked out too. I kept asking why and she kept saying she has to find herself. That she has to be selfish and figure out who she is. She said she wasn't seeing anyone else either. I practically begged her to stay, saying I would do anything to make it work but her mind was made up. She left her engagement ring on the nightstand and left. I feel so confused, torn, and betrayed. I regrettably called her 2 hours later to try and make sense of it all. I told her to be completely honest and tell me if we would ever get back together... I was met with silence and I said bye. I never pictured my life without her and I'm shocked at how quickly it ended. I've never cheated on her or even thought about other women and now everything has changed. I guess I just want to hear that it will be OK, or help from someone who has experienced something similar.

About two years ago, I fell in love with Girl A, but wasn't sure if she loved me back so I didn't do anything. A couple of months later I start dating another girl for about a year and a half. Around the last four months of dating with the girlfriend, I increasingly started hanging out more and more with Girl A and needless to say, I was still in love. After me and the then girlfriend broke up (beginning of october) , a week later, started becoming casual. FWB, and has progressed to a point where girl A is starting to fall in love with me. I've never really been the one to have a single life as I've never tried it before. About two days ago (four months later from breakup) , Girl A calls and tells me her feelings for me. Everything should be perfect as it is, but now those ""single life"" thoughts are crawling back and making me hesitant of going into another relationship. I am still in love with Girl A however but don't want to lose her at any cost, if I do make a bad decision. Is four months after a breakup an appropriate time to date and am I being delusional with all the single life schtick ? She has been the one I've been eyeing down for the last two years, and this is quite a dream come true. Thanks for listening.

Hi reddit. I need help. So I was at home waiting on my SO to get back from a trip. I was texting my male friend to pass the time. I told him I was bored out of my mind and looking for entertainment until my SO got home. My friend said we should go out to eat. I called my SO and asked if I could go out to eat with my friend (D). He said, ""don't you wanna wait til I get home?"" So I took this to mean he wanted to go out to eat when he got home. So I agreed and asked if I could invite D over to hang out some while waiting on him to return from his trip and he said it was okay, then we could all go out to eat together. Well, it was not okay. After dinner was all said and done and D was home, my SO started moping around. He said that he was super uncomfortable with me hanging out with D alone at our apartment. I asked why he didn't tell me that when I asked and he said that he was taken aback that I would even ask to hang out with a guy, so he couldn't form a coherent response and just said yes. He said he's surprised I disrespected our relationship like that. He is really upset and I feel so guilty, wrong, and like I fucked up everything. I can't stop crying. I am so sorry for what I did. How do I possibly make this better?

I [21 F] met someone [21 M] several months ago. It was all very nice, we went and did grown up things and he showed a lot of interest in me. I assumed it would be ok to fall for him - I hadn't been in a relationship for about 2 years, both my previous relationships were awful and I hadn't liked anyone since then. Not long after my feelings developed he ended up getting into the military and left for another city. Didn't handle this well at all but haven't been able to let go since. I've seen him since a couple of times, maybe twice. I know he has feelings for me as well, as he's told me. Last time he was here I pretty much broke down about it and admitted to him how much I missed him and still liked him and I guess he was trying to help but the things he was saying to me were not helpful. He told me that ""it wasn't the end of the world"" and that ""I needed to meet someone new"". I told him not to come back (again) but ended up caving (again) because we really like having sex with each other. It's just really shitty. I know we can't be together but I really refuse to move on. I used to absolutely love being single and hooking up with lots of men but after having a taste of a relationship I don't enjoy it at all. I don't like any of the other men I meet. I find all they want from me is sex, even if I don't sleep with them straight away and try to go through all the ""dating"" shit. I'm also insanely jealous of my friends who are in relationships. I'm at this really stressful, transitional stage of my life and the whole thing is so fucked up. Whenever I think about moving on I am terrified by the thought I might not feel that way I do about him any more. I'm also scared he will meet someone new who he likes more than me and I'll be stuck alone.

So, I've had this crush a a girl since we started working together in late February. Well, with the way things worked of both of our employer terms only went through late May. After that, we both keep in touch and went out on occasion with friends. Recently though, she starterd talking to me about more personal problems. She opened up to me. I opened up to her. The whole 9 yards. Even though she has a boyfriend (who I'm friends with), she's been coming to me with all her problems. So, today she lost her job, and I was the one who talked her down from freaking out about it. She came to my place after ""work"" and we had a few drinks. Then we went to a gathering of friends we had been planning on going to for the last few days. Then we ended up back at my place afterwards. Long story story she ended up in my bed, in my gym shorts and old t-shirt (letting me watch her change). We ""fell asleep"" and while ""sleeping"" we I ended up spooning her for about an hour. Then, her phone went off and it was her boyfriend and he was here to pick her up. So she left in my shorts, and went home with him. Did I miss something or miss read the situation? I'm a little upset. But I supposed that's what I deserve for crushing on a taken on a female.

My GF and I were both eachothers first boyfriend/girlfriend, lost our virginity to eachother, the whole nine yards. We we're going strong all summer and into the first couple weeks of Uni and then almost out of the blue she broke up with me. THigns had been a little rocky for the week prior but I did not see a break up coming at all. She said that the break-up has nothing to do with me, that she loved me still but not in love with me. She said I was the perfect boyfriend, always nice, caring, there for her when she needed me, etc. She said she just needed some time alone to figure out what she really wants. She also said that I shouldnt feel guilty if I want to hook up with other girls when I go out with my friends, I said I only wanted to be with her. I asked if she had found someone else and she said no, if she was going to hook up with other guys, she said not for a long time. I'm wondering if she's giving me the ""green light"" because she wants it? The whole conversation was close to two hours, there was a lot of hugging, a lot of crying (she cried the entire time), we're eachothers bestfriends and she wants to keep it that way, but its also entierely up to me if I want to stay friends. She said to text her when I'm ready, I figure I'd wait a week and see if she wants so meetup Sunday to talk/get final closure. I'm just not sure what to make of all of it, any opinions would be appreciated.

Hi, I'm starting to get a weird vibe of my boyfriend. He cheated on me a long time ago, and something about the way he is currently acting seems very strange. We've gone on double dates with another couple, and afterwards, he'll ask about both people out of curiosity. I never got the feeling he had a crush on them before. After meeting my new roommate, the bf becomes super friendly to her, asking her questions and trying to have a conversation which is fine. It starts being weird when he doesn't try to include me in the conversation. He explained to me that it's hard to keep his focus on two people...well, okay. He barely knows this girl and when we were leaving to go outside, my roommate wanted to ask me a question and he immediately came to her side and tried to talk to her. It just seems he's very eager to want to help her out or talk to her. He never had this kind of attitude with my other female friends. When we were out, he kept asking questions about her (her job, where she lived, where she went to school). Okay, that's fine. Later that night, he asked even more questions. This morning, he again asked questions about her. He barely knows about this girl and spoke so much about her. He has never asked this much about my previous roommate or any of my friends. It's super weird.

I am already developing feelings for him but a number of my friends have suggested that it's a bad idea to be dating this guy because of the baby of the way.

(F16) my boyfriend (M18) is going away to college in the fall, please read for story and I need advice. submitted 1 hour ago by Ave8 My boyfriend is going away to college in the upcoming fall. We have been dating for almost a year and a half. I love him and he loves me and we are both very happy. That being said, I know in the back of my mind that when he goes away, we will probably break up. I've been okay with that because I want him to be able to enjoy the college experience without anything holding him back. However, the closer it gets to him moving away, the more I question if I want us to stay together or not. Words cannot describe how happy I am with him and he tells me he feels the exact same way.

I know that is such a vague question... I've been searching subs for a post like this and haven't found one close enough to my situation. Hopefully I'm not beating a dead horse. The incident that prompted this post happened when I logged into fb and the first thing I see is a picture of my husband's ex that we're both friends with in a bikini and a headline saying ""frill_chill's husband likes so and so's picture from July 2014"". JULY 2014. My initial feelings were hurt because (and this is where I start to question if my feelings are justified/normal/over the top…) he never shows me attention on social media- ever. He is mostly a fb lurker and doesn't post or like many things. And also because this isn't the first time it's happened, but with other people (this can also be said of Instagram). Then I felt a little disgusted because, this wasn't a ""look at me I'm sexy in my bikini pic"". It was a candid, belly hanging out bikini pic. I look 100x better in a bikini than she does in that picture. Then I felt disrespected because who else is seeing that he is liking his ex-girlfriend's bikini pics from almost a year ago? It's not like she posted it today, he had to have been looking through her pictures to find it. To go along with feeling disrespected, he ""likes"" inappropriate pages (as close to porn as fb will allow). I'm having such a hard time trying to navigate between feeling immature for having issues with what my husband ""likes"" (or doesn't like when it comes to things I post) on fb and holding him accountable for things that may be questionable. So my questions: What do you consider ok for your SO to do on/with their facebook? Would you forbid them from doing certain things or accept that they have a private facebook page to do what they want?

I dated a really nice girl for about 6 weeks and we spent almost every day together during that time. We realized things were going too fast and we ended things because she had just gotten out of a relationship and I am possible moving for my career. After we broke up we still talked every day and would laugh and talk like normal but all of a sudden she is now being really mean and standoffish. I have no idea why she is being like this and it stinks because I feel like I am losing a good friend. I am pretty aware that it could be that she does not want to talk anymore but I am not sure why all of a sudden she is acting this way. She said in the past that she wants to protect herself from getting hurt by me so I am not sure if that has something to do with it. I don't think it is another guy in her life as well. I really just have no idea why all of a sudden she is being really mean to me. Also, I know 6 weeks is not a long time to date at all but we got along really great and I have never felt that good about a relationship that early on before.

I have never cheated on my wife, never verbally or physically abused her. I'm not perfect and I definitely have my flaws. But this past Tuesday she told me she needs some time apart and went to stay with her parents. My birthday was three days later on Friday. I have never felt pain like this before and now I feel like it will forever be tied to my birthday. We were supposed to meet on Saturday for a walk but I canceled because I felt like my emotions were so wild that it would absolutely end in disaster. We have been seeing a marriage counselor for months and at this point she says the issues are more to do with her versus stuff that I am doing. We started dating when she was 21 and she has definitely grown into a different person over the years. I always loved her though and encouraged her to pursue her interests and passions in life. She is a musician and found some other musicians to play with. She thinks this is what led to the downfall of her loving me. We don't have much in common anymore. She says she never cheated on me and I believe her. Our next marriage counseling appointment is Tuesday at 5pm. Waiting until then to speak or hear from her is driving me absolutely insane. I have been regretting canceling our meet up yesterday and it's taking every bit of my strength not to text or call her and beg to take me back. Then my emotions swing the other way and I'm 99% sure our marriage is over and now I'm starting to think I should just cancel the counselor appointment and tell her I want a divorce.

I am in a new relationship since December. We get on really well, he has been very respectful, he is lovely and I enjoy being around him. Our dialogue has been open, non judgemental and easy. He told me that he sometimes needs time to decompress and just be by himself. Which is totally good with me, I need my own space as well. I like that about him not needing to hang out with me 24/7. However he doesn't plan to come and see me, but just assumes that I am free by texting me two hours before planing to come over ""shall I come over after work?"". I am a planer and I don't want to guess the days when he is going to come over or not or wait for him by the door like a puppy just so he makes an appearance. He has also cancelled plans with me last minute. I know that he needs his space and I have no problem with him needing space. But I would like him to give me more notice. Which I think is reusable enough? I am not a native speaker so I am not always sure my delivery is the best when it comes to articulating my needs. I want to bring across that the above mentioned is important to me, but I don't want him to feel like I am clingy or nagging him. How can I tell him that I want him to plan meeting me two days in advance and cancel with a bit more of a notice period without sounding like business negotiations?

F24 1.5yr LDR with M24 Ive got a major issue- my boyfriend is gorgeous, brilliant, successful, and staunchly independent, and says he loves me. Doesnt sound like a problem right? Possibly relevant background: Historically, ive been an independent, high-self esteem woman, and so far its happened that Ive been(unintentionally!)..less invested than my male partners in previous relationships. I am not remotely a closed-off nor easily hurt person- ive been happily open about very real feelings, but theyve always eventually faded (and usually paled initially compared to my partners.) Ive previously had no issue accepting love. In my current relationship, ive realized I feel more strongly (for him) than I thought *possible*. And its such a positive relationship! yet for some reason, I cannot escape a growing, (and I think toxic) insecurity about his affection for me. I feel like i need to impress him, i constantly expect him to leave me, i worry about being too ugly for him, too untalented, and i *thirst* for compliments he never gives, (but words arent his style). Im POSITIVE that this, if it hasnt already, will manifest in ugly ways that would make him understandably LESS attracted to me! needy behavior, compliment fishing, jealousy, god knows. Where did this come from and how do i KILL IT? And how do i tell whats in my head, and whats real/reasonable? Is this a sign of a poor relationship and im missing it?? Is it just a me problem??

About 4 months ago my wife and I separated. In all honesty we were very close to divorce as she mailed me the documents and I signed them and sent them back. We were apart for almost 2 months and out of the blue she called me begging me to come back. I did come back and at first things were good until she became distant. Last weekend I had to plead with her to tell me what's wrong and she broke down saying she didn't know what she wanted. She wasn't sure if she anted to be married. Fast forward to Monday and I got a message from her former best friend that she had text messages to prove my wife was sleeping with one of her best guy friends. I was devastated and confronted her. She had the audacity to tell me she needed time to think and pick who she wanted to be with. I made the choice for her and I am now moving out and for some reason I feel like it's the end of the world. We were on the rocks for a few years and I honestly can't say I love her. I think part of my issue is she gets to be with someone and now I am alone. I think I am an attractive guy and never had issues getting attention from women but I'm older now and fear it's the end of the road for a relationship. I also struggle with thinking my wife is sleeping with this guy right now... Not that I lost my love but just frustrated about the sexual aspect. Hard to explain I guess.

I've been jokingly flirting with a friend of mine for months. I assumed that she was happy with her SO [M], and that she was straight. Wrong on both counts. When I saw her this past weekend, she told me the following: -Her boyfriend gets upset and assumes that they're fighting when she doesn't respond to his messages in a 'timely manner' -Her boyfriend fakes anxiety attacks to get her to come over / call him -Her boyfriend promised that their relationship would never be serious, and then started calling her 'his girlfriend' -She very badly wants out of the relationship, but is worried about her boyfriend's mental health if they break up. -She is attracted to me, and wants to start a relationship with me. I told her that I was interested in her as well, but the conversation doesn't get to stop there. I also wanted to tell her the truth. ""This guy is overly-attached and the relationship is unhealthy,"" that's what I would say to a friend. Unfortunately, this case comes with the awful addendum ""You should dump him and date me."" So I don't feel comfortable commenting at all. Now that she and I have expressed affection for each other I just stay quiet on the matter. So the choice presented is: a) Be supportive of her. Tell her that if she is unhappy, she should leave. After we've expressed interest in each other, this is the dishonorable choice, and perhaps the fastest way for us to start a relationship. b) Be honorable. Stay quiet on the matter and wait for their relationship to dissolve of its own accord. This is the unsupportive choice, and perhaps the slowest way for us to start a relationship. What should I do? Have I already fucked up by telling her that I want to be with her, too? [She and I haven't done anything past holding hands yet. It will stay that way until she leaves this guy]

My girlfriend has an internship working at a management company making $20 an hour and makes a lot in the week. At first, I was happy for her because it meant that she can buy whatever she wanted and still have enough for the bills. After a date we had, she went to her best friends house while I went to the bar to talk with my friends about whatever it is we talk about. When I told them that she makes more then me (for reference, I work at mcdonalds making minimum wage [which is 7.25 in my state]), they told me that this is unacceptable and that she will basically dominate the relationship since she makes the most. Of course, I told them that it is such a bull idea that she would ever do that because no right minded person would do that... right? Well, ever since that day, I have been thinking non-stop about how she will basically get to make the calls now since she makes more than me... but I know in my head that it's all bull but cannot get the feeling out of my head. What should I do, reddit? I honestly cannot believe I am posting this but I don't want it to affect my relationship with her because this is a stupid issue.

Hi! I'm sitting here stewing, and wanted to raise this question to see what others think. I don't want to be possessive or jealous, but this is niggling at me. My girlfriend attends a psych clinic as a patient and is currently out at a club having drinks with the male receptionist from there. She asked him out. He accepted. She actually asks single guys she meets out fairly often (she doesn't seem to meet many women she wants to start new friendships with - just single, fit, young guys - her 'I want to make new friends with you 'type'), but this one kinda bugs me because if you are working in the mental health field it seems kind of odd to accept a late-night invitation out from a patient. I should have thought professionalism would preclude this. Which makes me uneasy about it. I've mentioned this to her but told her she should do what she wants to do and invite out who she wants to invite out. As an addition, she can be pretty handsy with guys. It kinda shocked me how physically familiar she was with me how fast. And she really likes touching guys when she is speaking to them. On one hand it feels petty for me to worry about this - it is her intention that matters. On the other hand I intuitively feel she does get a charge out of feeling attractive and must know that a lot of guys would read repeated arm/hand/knee touching as flirtatious. I feel she gives mixed signals. Of course the relationship police aren't going to pull anyone over for this, there are no moral absolutes about this stuff, I should (and will, again) just talk to her. But I just also want to reality check. Is this something others would be cool with or concerned by? I do trust her, but have been cheated on before, so am not sure how much to trust *myself* here. Thanks

She says it's because of the way she grew up. She said that every boyfriend she's had, she has always refer to them as loser or moron when she talks to her friends. Example: ""I got the message from that idiot"". But in a very direct, not so jokingly, way. The problem is that she said this to my family members before. My uncle told me afterwards to just leave her. My family doesn't talk like that about anyone and especially not people we love. But I grew up in rural Ohio, from a small-town. This morning while I was driving her to work, her Boss asked her if I transferred her calls, and she replied ""Oh yeah I got it from that loser already."" I don't really know how to take this. It's not a big deal, but the last time she did that I told her it made me feel uncomfortable. She got defensive and seemingly expects me to change, rather than try to be more respectful. This plus the other stuff she does in our relationship makes me think she has very little respect for me. For instance if she wants something, she expects it done immediately or she'd throw a tantrum. Do I stay or do I go? She's the type that gets mad if someone is mad at them. So whenever there's a problem and I bring it up, she gets defensive.

Throwaway because my BF frequents reddit. My BF and I have been committed for around a year with absolutely no relationship problems. We seem to make a really good match and have a strong relationship. This is more about how I can help him than anything to do with our relationship. My BF took the traditional route of going straight to university after high school. He has been kicked out of two universities for failing grades and can only take a few classes at the community college as there are not many left to take. At this point he has been going to school for 4 years, with likely 2-3 more to go due to switching majors. If he fails the class that he is currently taking he will not be able to appeal to the local university until he passes the class, which may not be possible at this point. He is getting a lot of pressure from his parents to continue to go to school and get a STEM degree (which to be fair, he is fantastic at), however, he suffers from depression and ADD. He didn't get help for his depression until the past year or so, but the therapy and medication doesn't seem to get him motivated for school enough to pass the classes. I think it might be good for him to take a break from school to work and explore his interests and passions a little bit more, but the fear of student loans and parental pressure seems to be holding him back. He also seems to think that because he can't pass some of these classes that he is too stupid for his degree, which just isn't the case. How can I help show him that there are other non-university life/career options? How can I be a better support for him during this stressful time?

So we've been dating off and on for around 8 months. Things were rocky in the beginning but we had finally come to an understanding that we were happy with each other and planned on making this a serious relationship. Or so I thought... My birthday is 3 days after Valentines, which can be scary for a lot of men. I work for a company who abuses the ""holiday"" so I gave him the go ahead to veto any plans he may have had and told him to just focus on my birthday. Now, I am very low maintenance to begin with so I figured this would be an easy task for him. I am a huge pothead, I like sparkly smelly good things and anything with owls on it. Typical white girl shit. I feel like I'm not hard to please at all. So what does he do? We are laying in bed a week before my birthday and he tells me: >I'm real low on money >I almost got you a vape for $60 but I missed the coupon window >I thought about getting you a chill Em >you said we were good to not do vday so I didn't plan on that just so you know >you said you liked that one comic...what was the name of it again? Oh yea, that's right. I'll swing by sometime and pick it up for ya No talk of dinner plans, date night or anything. I'm well aware of his money situation and I would've been happy with a pizza and a card; yet now I'm sitting here stewing over this incident that makes me feel selfish and materialistic. But at the same time I'm so incredibly offended. Presents are my thing! I love planning them, giving/receiving the presentation...just all of it. I work really hard have come from little so anything that makes me feel special just does it for me. And I swear I've told him this many times before. So you would think that he (being an intelligent man) would have realized that my birthday is the time to go all out for me. But nope.

I understand cuddling isn't the same as cheating... but for some reason this hurt just as much. The fact that he was comfortable and felt a connection deep enough with another girl to cuddle with her seemed just wrong to me.. but please tell me if I'm being unreasonable. Here's the story... He went to the beach with a large group of friends. I couldn't go because I had class. He had offered to bring me if I wanted to, though I declined. He and his friends drank quite a bit on the beach, and while we were texting he admitted to being drunk. I trusted him very much, and told him I was happy he was having fun and to text me when he returned home so he could come to my place. It was been a few days, and I got a text from a girl neither he or I are good friends with, though we're all friendly. She said ""I feel like you have a right to know this. 'BOYFRIEND' and 'OTHERGIRL' were both drunk and sloppy and all over each other, I don't know what happened but I think you should find out."" I politely thanked her and then asked my boyfriend for the story. After quite a bit of prodding, he admitted to cuddling with her, going on a walk down the beach, and playing with her hair. This stung... I feel like he just went on an intimate date with another girl. I trust him that nothing else happened, but am I right to be hurt? He seems to think nothing of it, and says the girl who texted me misinterpreted the situation. I want to trust him, but I'm sure this girl wouldn't just make this up. We had a long talk with him apologizing and assuring me he didn't cheat. I know he didn't cheat, but I'm upset he got so intimate in this other way with a girl. Am I being completely unreasonable?

so ive liked this guy for quite a while,and on Halloween one of my guy friends told him that I like him(I'm not really mad at him or anything for telling) and another guy told me the following Monday that he knows now. i have just been waiting since then to see if he is gonna avoid me or say anything to me but he hasn't. usually we act like pretty good friends, sometimes hugging and we laugh at eachothers jokes and he seems interested in what I have to say. since halloween, he has been maybe a little less close, but not avoiding me by any definition of the word. we have been talking and it has been all normal. there have been a few opportunities for him to bring it up to me, but he hasn't. does he not like me and is trying not to be rude? does he like me but feels too shy to say anything?I was right about to ask him out before I learned that hr knew I liked him then I kinda lost my nerve. nobody currently knows that I know that he knows except the guy who told me. I get that this is a pretty immature problem but I really don't know what to do. if I haven't explained it well enough then I guess just leave a comment with what you're wondering.

Background: We have been dating 2 years, about 7 months ago, I discovered my boyfriend watching porn excessively and he messaged two reddit girls during our relationship. I discovered this and freaked out. He apologized and we tried/are trying to work it out. I'm also not perfect as I've had anger held against him regarding this. I reached my breaking point 2 weeks ago when he said he watched it again and I moved back home. I know he has made strides to not watch it half as much. I just keep on being reminded of the time when I first discovered it, when ever he does do it. I keep sounding like a broken record with my issue regarding this to him and even myself. I can't seem to just be okay with him watching porn, even though I've never had a problem with it in past relationships. My issue is how torn I am with the idea of him continuing this despite my asking him to please stop. I thought maybe it was depression that may have caused him to not care and be selfish with his needs. I don't like being controlling like this, I don't like asking him to stop, I don't want to be with someone who won't change and thinks he has changed drastically when he still did it and knew how it would upset me. Am I crazy for not getting over this? We have built so much together, we have a condo, I've helped him raise his 4 yr old son, we are close to each other's families...I still love him so much. I want to be with him. I want to try...is it worth it? Please if anyone has any advice or has gone through something similar, please let me know how it went for you. Thanks.

Just had a breakup, and I honestly do not know how to perceive or deal with it for that manner. Before people are up in arms, this relationship started with her cheating (making out,etc but not sex) on her 4 year boyfriend that she claimed she did not love him anymore, especially after 2 years. The first time we did this **I was not aware that she did have a boyfriend** but kept persisting even when I found out. She broke up with him one week after we did the said things, and then we became a thing. Fast forward 3 months, we are together but not officially dating, and to my knowledge she was not with anyone else for this time, she was the first one to say she was in love with me, we dated after these 3 months. Things were good, great actually, with her. She would always be truthful with me, even when it wasn't the answer I wanted to hear. I thought she was perfect, always caring, and sweet. I loved her. However, this weekend she came over and simply said ""this isn't working out"" and that she wasn't in love with me. I had no idea at all that she was going to say that, to my knowledge and how she was acting, I thought she loved me too. We ended it on 'good' terms, hugged it out, and she left. Then as far as I know, a couple days after she broke up, she's more than likely with someone that I knew was into her at her workplace. Throughout our relationship too, I will honestly say I had anxiety that she would cheat, because of how we started. But sometimes it wasn't warranted because she appeared honest. - I give everything way to easily in my relationships. I give give give without worrying about getting back, even if it means leaving a few friends in the process. With that I gave that love, and feel cheated in that manner. I know the relationship is over, and I don't feel it would be good to pursue it, but I can't stop thinking about it and her. Reddit, how do you cope with ""fast and all of a sudden"" heartbreak?

And this post has nothing to do with her. But, I did have someone I went out with earlier in the year, I liked her at the time but she didn't reciprocate and we stayed as friends. However that relationship grew and I talked her several months after, asking whether anything changed between us. Essentially we were the same as before, friends but closer than that. Then we made out recently, but a couple of days later, she said she wanted to tone it down and hang out on the more mellow side. Keep in mind I still had a thing for her, but not to the point where I was obsessed; it probably just enhanced our relationship. Then she contacted me couple of weeks ago saying she wants to hang out again, I agreed. Now, I was also hanging out with this other girl at the time, and we both pretty much clicked - to the point I got into a relationship with her. I then told my other friend about what was happening and I wanted to tone it down, she basically flipped her shit and ended our close friendship. Now, Im annoyed and quite hurt at this, because honestly I thought for a while that she wanted to remain friends, and her telling me to tone it down a couple days after we kissed pretty much confirmed that. She was also dating at the time so I understood her position. So what the fuck happened?

As I said in the title, I love my boyfriend. We've been together for 2.5 years, and we're supposed to be moving in together at the beginning of September. I am 20, and he is 22. However, every time he drinks, he becomes extremely belligerent. When I try to tell him that he's drunk, I've been drinking, and we should talk about it in the morning when we can better understand each other without the cloud of alcohol, he starts arguing. Yesterday, he spent two hours yelling at myself and one of his friends about how we ""never listen to him"". When we told him we should talk about it outside so as not to wake everyone else in the house, he started yelling even louder and forced me to ""look him in the eyes while he's talking to me"", and accused me of never listening and not being attentive as a girlfriend. At this point I started crying and left. When I returned, he attempted an apology but ended up ranting again about how I ""never listen"". He's done things like this before, but it only happens when he's been drinking. I DEFINITELY appreciate his argument, and told him that I understand his feelings about me ""not listening"", but this doesn't seem to get through to him. Mainly, I'm looking for advice on how to talk to him about this. He's not an alcoholic - we rarely drink. I just don't know how to calmly approach him and tell him that his behaviour towards me and his friends while he's drinking is not okay. Any tips on how to go about this?

Original post: So since I last posted a little over 2 weeks ago, here's what happened: He interviewed for a job overseas (with the company he currently works for) and was told in the interview that if he would spend a year or two making some sizable deals with current clients they would consider him again. (Basically, to do what they hired him to do in the first place and not fuck around on the internet all day) Then this past Tuesday, he came home from work and announced that he was buying a house. A few days later, I went on his phone to look up a friend's number, it turns out that he'd already put in an offer on a house--I thought that he meant that he was just starting to look. (Before anyone accuses me of snooping: A. he doesn't lock his phone and B. he left the text from his realtor open) So I sat him down and we had a talk. He was planning on moving out anyway, either to live with a friend whose roommate is moving out, or into this house he's buying if the offer is accepted. He was doing this in plans to break up with me as well. So we kind of came to the agreement that this was best for both of us. With respect to money issues, he did offer to pay for half of the rent on our current place and help with the bills (our lease doesn't expire until April and he makes more than twice what I do). I'll probably reject the offer to help with the bills, as since summer's nearly over (I live in AZ, so I am speaking relatively) our electric will go way down soon and water and internet are cheap. I don't use the Xbox Live account at all and I can get my own Netflix account. I'm going to cancel the gym membership that we're not really using anyway. We didn't have any shared finances beyond bills and rent, so it's a little bit easier. I just wanted to thank the people who answered my first message. I posted it rather late at night for western hemisphere redditors, but a few people did respond and I appreciated their advice.

Hey Reddit, I'm a student currently on exchange in California for 6 months. My gf is back home in Australia. She has always loved EDM (electro dance music) and she is the one who introduced me to the whole culture. She has also been wanting to go to this famous festival called EDC for years, which never happened because she has had exams during that period each year. As I am in California this year, I will be able to go to the festival and told my gf that I wanted to. To my surprise, she became furious that I would consider going without her, told me that I was ""backstabbing her"" and that I was ""stealing her thing"". I feel like she is being unreasonable, considering that she will have the possibility to go and most probably will go the following year when I will be in Australia finishing university. She is asking me not to go, as she says it will ""hurt her"", and also told me that if I asked her not to go the following year, she would wait. I really don't know if I'm being unreasonable or not to want to go, can you give me a second opinion? Thank you

EDIT: She is 32F, I am 26F. I don't know how I mixed that up. I have been seeing Jennifer for about two months now, meeting through a mutual friend. At first I noticed she seemed a little well off; wearing designer suits, having a very nice (but not donald trump size) home. She would also take me to very expensive dinners and pay for all of it, but never let me see the bill. I never really thought much of it because I came from an upper-middle class family and do pretty well for myself Last night, though, the mutual friend that had introduced us (Kate) told me that Jennifer is rich. Like insanely rich. Daughter of multimillionaires rich. Jennifer has never once had to work in her life, went to a very nice school, and rides horses as a hobby. She owns three. I am not a gold digger by any means but this has definitely changed how I've looked at her. I really do like her, and would love to pursue something further, but I'm worried I will look like I'm only in it for the money. I do know for a fact she isn't using her money to seduce me. She doesn't know I know, and she has literally never talked about money in front of me. She's incredibly modest. Reddit, what do I do? I'm afraid if I tell her what Kate said it will scare her off.

My girlfriend has a few psychological problems which affect our relationship in many many ways. From mood swings to strong anxiety and jealousy, she has many problems which im trying to help her with. This process is very hard on me though. Outbursts of rage over (for me) minor things are very common and take quite a toll on my energy. I turned to friends for support, advice on what i can do, and for hugs and in general for the feeling that im not such a bad person. Now: she feels I violate her privacy with this. I try to explain her situation to my friends so they can empathise with mine and her situation. She feels threatened by that. She claims that most people are a threat to her and i should not be handing them the weapons for destroying her. While i can understand her need for privacy, i would also like to be able to talk to my friends about it. We tried to talk about it, but she says its a hard limit for her and there will be no negotiation on this. I tried to make her see my position in this, and she gave me permission to talk to two of my friends (one which i see rarely and one which i generally do not tend to for comfort). She also said since she is working hard on herself, i should be too: i should be strong enough to cope with her without any support from friends. I disagree. Nobody should be isolated like this from his friends and this behaviour bares characteristics of an abusive relationship. So i tend to the internet, since im not allowed to talk to most of my friends anymore: maybe someone here has some insight for me on what i can reasonably do in this situation.

I'm using a throwaway just in case! So I am in a relatively small program at a college. I primarily hang out with two other girls named Sarah and Josephine. Josephine acquired Laura as an acquaintance who became ours and will sit with us on the rare occasions she comes to class. The problem is that Laura never comes to class yet expects us to give her the notes. Her excuse for not coming to class is that she lives 30 minutes away walking (she can take the bus its included in our tuition). So last year, Laura was in the same boat and would first ask Josephine for notes but Josephine would take her notes by hand so then for Laura to get the notes she'd have to come to campus. Then she asked Sarah for notes and a few times last year Sarah said okay and gave the notes to her. This year, its happening again. We have tests all next week which she has none of the notes for and asked Josephine for notes who again, since didn't have any digital copies couldn't send and is now asking Sarah! She asked Sarah over facebook and Sarah hasn't opened up the message. Sarah has no idea what to do. I don't think it's right to send her the notes when we go to class, but I have no idea how we can say no.

I'll try and keep it short for you. Basically, I (18) and my girlfriend (also 18) have been together for over a year. We're in our first year of college, albeit 360 miles and 6 hours driving distance away. We've made a long-distance relationship (LDR) work—trust me on that one. It's basically been the best time we could have ever asked for. Her parents, of traditional Vietnamese culture and upbringing, are understandably strict and not as progressive as most American households are. The Asian parent stereotype of demanding good grades to lead to a well-paying job is, unfortunately, often *not* a stereotype. So even though she has pulled great grades in her first quarter of college, her parents simply cannot stand the idea of her having a boyfriend: it can hamper her ability to study, it can distract her, it is ultimately harmful. They have always felt this way, but just tonight, they pulled her aside, sat her down, and told her to break up with me, once and for all. They've met me, although I suppose reluctantly. They mentioned I'm ""not that special,"" yet they also contradictorily say, ""Nothing against him"" (I'm roughly translating their Vietnamese into English). I don't necessarily need to bore you and flesh out all the details here. All I can say is that even though I know that my SO and I are young, even though statistically our relationship apparently shouldn't work, even though the odds seem overwhelmingly stacked against us...I just don't think it's right that any relationship should end like this—especially since we are adults by law. With all that said, I have one question in addition to a request for advice: *Is anyone here able to translate English into Vietnamese?* I have an idea, and it's far-fetched, but really, is there anything to lose at this point? I want to write a letter—a very calm one—to her parents, and RESPECTFULLY and CAREFULLY tell them a bit from my perspective. No barbs, no insults—just a letter that just might change their mind.

So I've known this guy for a while,we used to hang out get drunk when I was in college. I always thought of him as a bro and that he didn't want anything from me. We used to make out here and there but that's it.... we lost touch after I graduated college (he tried to stay in touch but I was just going through some things and isolating myself from everyone). Finally about a year later I got in touch and we hung out this past new years. We've hung out a few times since then and finally the last time we hung out I ended up pretty much begging to fuck. As soon as we started having sex I realized how tired I was and got him to come on top, well he was exhausted too after the two day bender we had with no sleep so I asked if we could stop. There's no point in having tired sex, especially the first time. Anyways, before we even got to the bedroom we talked about what we wanted. I said I was looking for a boyfriend and missed having a relationship. He said he isn't good with feelings and anxious. He told me he tried to get with me in college and I told him I was unaware and thought of us as friends since all we did was drink and crash. I asked why he never asked me on a date and he said if I didn't disappear for a year he probably would have. I asked why he didn't want to give me a chance and go on a date now and he said he was nervous because I just showed up back in his life. Before we had sex he used to send me cute texts, now it's just occasional small talk. I think I totally fucked it all up. He wanted to take it slow and I flung myself at him. I'm just wondering whether he's lost all respect for me and will never see me in a relationship way? Male perspective would especially be appreciated.

We only see each other on the weekends - she comes over after she gets off work at 10pm on Friday and I drop her off at the train station Sunday evening (around 6pm) - and I believe the length of our relationship (8 months) warrants a face-to-face breakup (not email, not text). I'll keep my reasoning for breaking up brief, as it's a lot of small and some medium sized things, but my heart is just not in the relationship anymore. It's as simple as that and that's the reasoning I'm planning on giving her. I was planning on telling her after I drop her off at the train station because I wanted to give myself one more weekend to absolutely make sure that's what **I** want (also the timing would feel weird to say I'm going to pick her up at work on Friday, breakup, and send her back to the train station). So here's the wrinkle. She had breast implant surgery last Thursday (Feb 18), and since she is a transwoman, she was also off her hormone treatment for a few weeks (although she is back on them, she warned me she might be extra emotional during that time). She might also be experiencing post-surgery depression (I seriously did not know that was a thing before this morning). She's in a state where she needs me to be emotionally supportive, and here I am planning on doing the exact opposite. So reddit, here I am. Do I still breakup with her on Sunday? I'm travelling for business the next two weekends, so I won't see her until March 18th and feels wrong to continue for that long if I'm not interested. Is there another solution I'm not seeing?

Before we get into the judgement of ages and poor decisions, just hear me out. I know things moved too fast and I know that trying to say it was different for me would just be me convincing myself. I know it was rushed and I am an idiot for that. Anyway, I have been with my fiance for about six months now. Everything has been great even when telling her I was enlisting in the Air Force. She made it very clear to me even on our first date, that me enlisting and having to be away would not be an issue. Typical pre-relationship assumption. Fast forward to now and we have been engaged for a bit and things are still going well. I got my job contract and from speaking with knowledgeable people in the job and experience, I will be gone a lot. More than she anticipated. And she was a wreck when I told her that. She is not a very independent person, and she typically is quite emotional and in need of attention. I know, bad combination for someone enlisting. I do love her and me having these thoughts are not due to lack of feelings. I just feel now that ending things and having immediate yet short misery and heartbreak is better for both of us in the long run rather than us get married, move her to a place where she knows no one, and me be gone for months at a time without being able to speak. Her feelings on this matter have already shown and all she does when we are together now is cry or get emotional about it. But she says she will ""deal with it."" Its not fair to her to just have to deal with a situation and it is not fair to me to be miserable knowing I am doing this to her. I know that if I end it, may it be the best thing, her family who have been good to me will resent me, her brother will express his anger a lot, and I will feel extremely shitty for a long time. But I do love her and I don't want either of us to settle in situations because we feel we must.

My FWB and I have had a falling out. Basically, I developed feelings & he started sleeping with others. Instead of talking to me, I was told by someone else that he wasn't being honest with me & it really bothered me. I knew we weren't committed but don't need to be lied to. I took some time to evaluate the situation and went No Contact. In doing that, he is now being extremely callous and told me basically I was obsessed with him but closed it with let's be friends. I have finally gotten myself together & want to have an open discussion. I should have done that ages ago but I was insecure & scared. I have reached out to talk it out and see if we can remain friends but now he won't talk with me face to face & acts like I am a psycho.

Alright, I've just started reddit so forgive me for anything un-redditlike. I'm a fifteen year old heterosexual boy from Wales and I have never had a girlfriend. Ever. I'm pretty sure that I'm the only guy in my year (grade for you North Americans) who has never been in a relationship. The furthest I've been with a girl was a friendly hug! I wouldn't say I'm ugly (or good-looking for that matter) but I try my best to be nice and funny around girls (I make them laugh, I open doors for them etc.) but it doesn't seem to work. This kinda sucks because all of the impolite guys in my year get girls. I do like a girl, I just don't think she feels the same, what do I do? Thanks.

I found out my girlfriend of three and half years cheated on me with a [33 M] that she works with. For the past 6 months or so, I have not been very affectionate (including sex, maybe 3 times a month. Zero in the past 2 months). But for all time before that, things were fantastic between us. I have been undergoing a lot of depression issues that I haven't really talked about with anybody including her. Things started getting bad about a month ago. She was getting desperate for attention from me, and I admit was not being the most affectionate partner. She started leaving every weekend to hangout with her friends overnight. I had no problem with this. I realized after a few weeks that I genuinely did not like her being gone all the time and decided to man up and stop being so distant all the time. I started inviting her to go on date's with me, movies, etc. She declined these offers and kept going out. Finally, after about a month or so, I started getting suspicious of what was going on and why she wouldn't stay home anymore. I used find my iphone (we know each-others apple ID's and use it to meet at places, we have done this for years.) and she had just that night, changed her password. She refused to tell me where she was because she was ""afraid I would show up and make a fool out of myself"" and yet, would not come home. I then went on her email, (also saved on my computer; passwords are mutually shared and neither of us care). This where I found messages between her co-worker and her setting up times during lunch to go have sex in the parking lot of her office. Turns out there were a bunch of guys at her friends house with them and that was what she was hiding, which led me to find these emails. I immediately kicked her out of the house. It has been two days and she has been telling me she only did it because I would not give her affection and she had been trying for so long. Am I in the wrong here? Is cheating, cheating, or did I lead her to this? I really need advice on what to do.

Hi! I've been with my gf for only 3 months. My first relationship. We are both from the same country and both of us living abroad in Ireland atm. I am working and she is studying. She was going to move back to our home country after graudation (this May) but she is applying for jobs here just to be closer to me which I think is great. She is very career oriented and will probably get a great job here. However... even before I met her I had plans of moving to Australia for a year for college. The start date is next February. I haven't applied (i already know i will get in though) yet because I feel selfish even wanting her to live here instead of moving back home and then I would move in 8 months... and I think she is too career oriented to just randomly quit and move to Australia for a gap-year with me after getting a great job here. I Dont know what to do... or even how to say this to her. We are great together and I *really* like her and I dont want her to move *home* in May.. and I dont feel like waiting with college because I dont want to be 30 when applying. I also feel like it's weird to say: *I might be moving away next year and I want you to go with me* after just being together for 3 months. Is it? Is our relationship doomed to fail if I tell her? I *could* stay here in Ireland with her but I am *SO* bored with my current job and I need to get more educated. IF the relationship would end sometime, I would probably regret not getting that degree. Sorry if this seems confusing.

I (M 21) have been in an amazing relationship for almost two years with my beautiful girlfriend (F 20) who I love very much. We've been extremely happy besides a few minor things that everyone has. This is one of them. Early in our relationship, we had talked about past relationships and specifically this one that kind of worries me. There's this guy she pretty much grew up with and had lived down the street from her whole life. She has admitted to having strong feelings for him before, and even left a previous relationship specifically for this guy. Through my relationship with her, he hasn't had much presence until recently. I noticed she would talk about him more and more, and now they're even going to the same college together and living in their own apartments across the street from each other. I have continuously expressed my feelings to her about how I'm a little wary about it, but she doesn't seem to give a shit. Last night, she said she was going to visit him around midnight and was there for about half an hour. I know I'm being paranoid and I feel so guilty about it. She thinks that I want her to stop being friends with him, but I don't want that at all. I want her to have friends, especially life-long friends. I dont want her to give that up because of me. Im just nervous because of her past feelings for him. Am i overreacting about this? Im kind of weirded out about last night. Do you think there is nothing to worry about? How can i become comfortable with this? What can both of us do to make me less nervous and more okay with it?

My ex and I, both 23, were together for a year and a half. During that period we came close to breaking up several times, but always made it work and continued forward stronger and more in love than ever. We had an amazing summer, felt like we were insanely compatible, and both thought seriously about marrying each other. He told me that I was his ideal woman several times and that he had never been so in love. Most of our problems stemmed from my poor relationship with my parents, who have always been abusive and invalidating. When stressful things happened with my family, I would find myself immensely sad but couldn't let my ex in because of all the shame I had been brought up with about sharing these things. After a trying month in August he broke up with me. I finally gained the courage to cut ties with my parents and see a therapist who specializes in these sorts of issues. I feel so much better and am demonstrably more stable, now that I've embraced and been working through my trauma. Since the breakup I've confessed to my ex all of the awful experiences that I had as a child. He says he feels like he understands me so much better now and feels like our issues have finally been resolved. He says that he's still really tired from everything that happened, though, and doesn't think he loves me anymore. I do understand this; when he's hurt he needs space, and I made the mistake of not giving him that initially. We hung out several times after the break-up and everything seemed great, but he decided recently that he just couldn't take the ambiguity and needed to come down one way or another. He said he wasn't coming back and needed to not see me for a while. I've been trying to give him this space but it is really hard. I can't help but hope that we can finally work things out now that my family situation is out of the way. He agreed to get back in touch with me later when he's had enough time and if he's single. I know I can't wait around for him forever, but I love him so much and really do want this to work. Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.

I'm using a throwaway account due to the fact that many of my friends know my Reddit account. I have been going to a Boarding School since April or so, and it's definitely a big change from my past life. Everything is much more... calm. No public school drama. It's nice. A few months ago, a girl [F16] came here from a similar situation I was in. Each of us weren't doing too well back home and needed a change. At the time, I was still stressed out from having to throw away my entire past life and start over. This included my Ex, [F17] who I haven't talked to since I left. I promised myself that I wouldn't keep myself in the past. The new girl, who by the way is the one in the title, has really helped me through the entire process and vice versa. We've become best friends, and I spend more time with her besides my roommate. We make plans every weekend to do things, like going out to a movie or going to a baseball game. It's never a date, we just go as friends. It's all good and well, but we always get asked if we're dating by other kids. *As I'm typing this, I've gotten a text from a friend ASKING ABOUT THIS EXACT TOPIC* It's not that I've had enough, but its getting on my nerves. The thing is... I wouldn't mind getting into a relationship with her. She's good looking and we're pretty comfortable with each other. But I'm trying to drill it into my head that we're just friends. We've talked about going to each other's weddings, and visiting each other in college. Where do I take this? What do I do? I'm not madly in love, but I do see this as a good long term relationship opportunity.

A few weeks ago my girlfriend and I got into the same college, however she also got into her dream college. The rankings are not too far apart but it is pretty obvious that her dream college is more prestigious. After talking long and hard, she decided to come to the one I was going to. Of course, I would LOVE it if she comes to the same college as me. I love her dearly and because we are going to the same one, my mindset right now is to hold on for as long as possible... forever??? I never forced her to come with me, and she gave me a decent number of reasons why she decided this college that are not related to me. But damn, I feel so selfish. She could possibly be ruining her life. What scares me is that we have no idea what is going to happen on the other side. What if we change there? What if it restricts us from meeting new people? What if I feel obligated to always be an angel for her because she chose this for us? What's surprising is that I'm not even a very good boyfriend. Sometimes I overreact, sometimes clingy, sometimes a little possessive, sometimes a giant asshole. The fact that she's willing to sacrifice that for me makes me love her even more.. but what will happen when it fades? Right now right here, I want to be with her for the rest of my life. Married, kids and what not (we always talk about this) but I'm not sure if my age and maturity will back this up in a few months or years. TBH our relationship is not that strong at all, we fight all the time, little fights about big things, big fights about little things. We're young and stupid but maybe that's what creates our love? I know I repeated this a million times but I really want to be with her forever, but i want us to be happy. AND we known each other for our whole high school but we've only been dating for 4 months. And BTW we both submitted are SIR to the school so reading stuff about why we SHOULD'NT go to the same school won't be that easing for me ;(

I (f/24) have gone on three dates with one guy (32/m) and two dates with another (26/m). I happened to mention to both of them that I'm going to be going to a food festival in our city with my friend next weekend. One guy said ""awesome! I'm going with a male friend of mine, we should double date!"" I just tried to brush off this comment. And the other guy said he was going too, and that he's actually going by himself. I'm internally freaking out because even though I have only been casually going on a few dates with both guys, it's still going to be awkward. It's a food festival in a fairly small park so it's not like we won't run into each other. Plus the guy I have been on three dates with now greets me by kissing me. How awkward would that be if the other dude was there? Also not going is not an option because I already bought tickets. Damn it, I was just looking forward to eating some delicious grub with my friend!! Ugh. What should I do?? Suggestions?

Hi, I'm a 27 year old software engineer in Boston. I have had a whole host of issues after breaking up with my old girlfriend, and I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice. We had an excellent relationship for most of the 3 years, and we were talking about maybe getting married and plans like that. We both had stable jobs, and things were looking pretty good. Then, driving to my apartment one day from work, I was smashed by a truck running a red light (or so I'm told). I don't actually remember it, it is just sort of a gap in my memory. I suddenly came to 2 days later in a hospital bed, where I learned I had broken 17 bones and would not be able to leave the hospital for months. My girlfriend never came and visited me even once during the 5 months I was there, and I even had some family members call her phone, but she seemingly had just vanished. I was heartbroken. But after returning home, I found expensive equipment missing from my apartment: my TV, laptop, iPad, and other items. I was confused and I spent a while tracking her dad's cellphone number down in phone books. When I called him, she answered and cursed me out for ""leaving"" her after I got in the crash. Apparently she thinks I abandoned her by being confined to a hospital bed for months. She told me she smashed all my expensive shit in a rage. Is there anything I can do about this? Any legal options, settlements, etc? My life was already thrown off course by a mile after the crash, and I want to start rebuilding, but this business with my ex has put me down a bit.

How do I deal with my anxiety appropriately around her? It ranges from seeing her active on messenger at the same time as another guy she hung out with the other day to her feeling the need to hide things from me for the sake of keeping me happy, nothing major at all but I worry for it turning into something bigger! I'm a paranoid piece of shit and I want it to stop, now. I can't continue making her feel guilty, as unintentional as it is I still manage to do it somehow. How do I let her know that I'm doing everything I can to push away my anxiety and that I love her more than anything, also that she doesn't make me unhappy. To give an example as to how she feels she was talking to a friend of mine about me, how she could never lie to me, before this she told me she was going to town before coming to my house, after asking what she'd do for two hours and why she doesn't invite a friend out such as *insert name* she then tells me she's going with *insert my friend's name* and assures me it was coincidental to begin with for whatever reason. She doesn't want me to panic and treads carefully about these sorts of things and I really don't want her to! Please be as brutally honest as you can, I need to know how to get over this. She loves me, I know that much, but I don't want this anxiety to go on. How do I move on from feeling anxious? She's convinced I don't fully trust her and it hurts, I lack a lot of self confidence, but she knows I love her. I NEED TO REDEEM MYSELF AND CHANGE MY WAYS, I hate how I act! Please help, Thank you

Today my boyfriend of 1 year and 1 month, opened up to me about his previous relationship, he had never told me anything about it whatsoever until now. A girl that he dated for 8 months was physically abusive towards him, and threatened him with stuff like ""If you try leaving me I'll tell the police you're the one who hit me"" and a bunch of other horrible stuff. I was shocked and I tried to comfort him but I didn't really say much because I was pretty much speechless. I don't know how exactly I'm supposed to react to this sort of thing, and another crappy thing is this girl, goes to our school. And I was extremley upset hearing about it and I don't want to see her face at school because I will probably feel like punching her in the face. I'm really pissed off about it, even though I wasn't with him at the time so maybe that's weird for me to feel this way. Does anyone else have experience with their SO opening up about something bad that happened in past relationships? How exactly am I supposed to react now that I have this knowledge?

Sorry if this is the wrong sub, if it is, let me know and I'll delete and repost. So, my husband is 21 and I'm 20. We've been together for a couple of years. We have a 4 month old son and I'm a stay at home mom. He works in the oil field and is gone 3 weeks out of the month. Im starting college this week, so we'll be seeing even less of each other. In the beginning, our sex life has been alright. He always wanted sex and I was perfectly okay with that. During my pregnancy, it was a little hard with positions but we still had sex regularly. Now, he never wants it. At all. When I try to initiate, he just turns me down. And says I'm annoying him. He's even gotten mad at me and told me that I've always been a slut and all I want is sex. I've never cheated or anything before at all. What really bothers me is that if I go through his history on his phone, every day, there's porn. He masturbates EVERY. DAY. Yet at home, he won't even touch me. I feel so lonely and I honestly feel like the ugliest person in the world. I'm so frustrated and hurt and upset. Talking to him is pointless. I don't know what to do from here. Any suggestions?

Alright, so I live with my dad and two older brothers. One of them (Drew/18) is really great, he has a job, cleans up after himself, doesn't really bother anyone. All around good guy, while my other brother (Chris/21) is... well terrible. All he does is still around our house and play video games. He doesn't have a job, he invites all his friends over who just eat our food and leaves a mess. And the worst part he does drugs, he sits around smokes weed and snorts pills. Chris has smoked weed for a long time and I never really minded that, but when thats all you do, it a bit ridiculous. The pills is really the thing that bothers me. As cheesy as this is gonna sound, he's become a different person. He gets mad really easy. He steals my money. He punches holes in the walls and he's punched a hole in my door (because I didn't wanna give him my lighter, cause he'd steal it) I'd ask him to go buy something for me, like drinks, and he'll go spend my money I give him and not get me my drinks until weeks later. My dad knows about him stealing money and and this other stuff he does, but won't do anything about it, but lecture him. I don't think my dad knows about him doing drugs and I've always wanted to tell him, but knew I couldn't because there's some stuff Chris can tell on me about. I called my mom (who is in our life, but just lives far away) and told her about it. She told me not to tell my dad and that she would handle it. When we went to visit her she talked to Chris about it and Chris said he'd stop, but of course he never did and now it's gotten to a point where I'm just sick of it, but I have no idea what to do. I tried talking to my dad about kicking him out or something, but he said he wouldn't, because that's his son. So I really have no idea what to do anymore...

My current gf and I had been hooking up during the past two summers before we decided to date. During the year we would go back to school in separate cities. We would hook up when she came back for holidays however we were not exclusive. This past summer, we got closer. I made a trip to her city for a weekend a couple weeks after she left for school and asked her if she wanted to date. She was excited as she had never dated anyone before and I believe has low self esteem because of it. The next night after we began dating she asked (While drunk): ""Why do you want to date me? I'm a slut"". I believe this is because of her low self esteem, I didn't ask how many people she slept with because I don't want to know. At a concert we had sex in a washroom, I thought this was just a crazy fun thing to do. While driving back the next day, I said it was a first for me and she said she had done it once before. I was a bit taken aback but avoided making it awkward. I have known her for 10 years however I don't know this part of her life. We have a very close friend group and I'm not at all worried about her cheating on me, she is very into me. I am just having a very hard time getting over the idea that she has had a lot of one night stands. I find solace in the fact she has never dated before, I think that's pretty special.

Background: I'm 19, Male and live in the UK. I study at college, don't work. I have never been very social (same as my friends) and i'm quite boring. I have no idea what's wrong with me and I am feeling really depressed about it. For about 3 years I have been very confident with girls. Talking, kissing, sex (most have been one time things) but I have never been in a relationship before, and for some reason this has really started to impact my life in many aspects. I see some of my friends in great relationships and for some reason around 3/4 months ago it started to make me feel sort of lonely and depressed. - I have lost all of my confidence, don't speak to any girls anymore (don't feel as if I can communicate with them and I have never been able to bond with them in any other way apart from the sort of ""lets fuck eachother"" way) - Lost all motivation for anything - Hardly go out anymore, a drink with my friends (small group of M friends) is about it every weekend - Gained weight, become very unfit - Stopped caring about everything - Sit around all day and do nothing if i'm not at college This is really starting to get to me, and I don't know what to do. I feel as if i'm never going to have a relationship and just fucking around with girls isn't what I wan't to do anymore. I wan't to share my life with someone and with all of this that's probably never going to happen. Not looking for attention, i'm looking for advice if anyone can offer any/help me in any way.

Things have been going well, and he's met a few of my friends, though I haven't met any of his yet. We're at the point where we're discussing meeting each others families. Anyway, one of my friends signed up to tinder this week, and wanted to see what my profile had been like when I was on it, so I logged in, and decided for the hell of it to check my boyfriend's profile. Which said he was last active 1 hour prior. I checked again today, just to confirm my doubts, and once again, he'd been active only a few hours before.

I've been through an abusive relationship, and have been single for nearly 8 years. I had a 2 short term ""relationships"", the last one was 5 years ago. I felt pressured because of my family (and basically, society's) expectations, because where I live, women around my age are either in a long term relationship or married already. My best friends that I met in college are both married & have a little family of their own. My close friends at work who are around my age are all in a relationship or have kids. In the last company I worked for, I told the truth and kept getting the usual questions like why are you still single, what's wrong with you, don't you want to be with a man, etc .. So when I transferred to my current company, I told this lie. I didn't expect to make a connection with anyone at all, so I thought what would I lose? I feel terrible for lying to the new friends I made at work, but back when I started & decided to lie about this, I thought I will only have a short stint at this company and that I'd soon work abroad. I was wrong though, I grew to love my job and the people I work with. Trying to keep up this lie is getting harder. Would they hate me too much if I tell them the truth? It would lower their opinion of me, I don't doubt that, but I'm tired of lying. :( Any advise/insights would be appreciated.

This will seem really petty but I was hoping I could get advice. I am about to see a childhood friend (we're both female, 26) who I haven't seen since her wedding reception 2 years ago. I have literally only talked to this friend a few times in the last 5 years but next month I'll be seeing her at a mutual friends hen party. Even though I live in a different country and wasn't invited to the full wedding, I flew in especially for it. Basically this was my first wedding and I didn't know proper wedding etiquette. Not only did I not reply to the evening invite (I didn't realise this was necessary!?), I also didn't give a wedding gift. So I showed up unexpectedly, stayed 2 hours and gave a card with no money inside like an idiot. Now a few years have passed and I've been to lots of weddings I've realised I must have seemed really rude and I've also heard various couples complain about guests who didn't give them adequate gifts. I feel really bad! I just asked my parents who were invited to the evening do also but didn't go, and they said they gave my friend a card with £100 inside! She is a lovely person and I want to explain myself/make it up to her. Is it too late?? If you were this friend what would be a good way to apologise? Would it be weird to now give her £50 in a card even though the wedding was years ago and I haven't seen her since? I feel really pathetic asking about this but it's worrying me!

Currently I'm in a LDR I am 18 and she is 17. After 2 months I see her for a week and after 4 I see her for 2 months. We've been dating for 6 months end of this month. I love her, I have already told her that and she replied with the same. Tris was the last time I saw her 2 months ago. Now during the 2 months I haven't seen her I have become attracted to a friend of mine, which is naturally, you can be in love with someone but be attracted to someone else, it's a natural biological function. So I found out this girl likes me, and she knows I have a GF, this was a month ago. I'm pretty sure she's over me now and put me in the friendzone, which is good. Anyway I am attracted to her and will never go for her as long as my GF is in the picture, don't want to ruin my relationship. Now I have a bad jealousy, but I haven't felt it in years since I haven't been that attracted someone in a while, I felt it last night though. I was out with friends and she was part of the group. We met some friends who we know and these two guys were going after her like crazy, and she was all over them and they were all over her (she was pretty drunk, she's not like this naturally). She was over other guys, licking the guys who were after her and letting people touch her ass. At the end of the night she didn't hook up with anyone, but that's besides the point. THe whole time I had bad jealousy I just wanted her and them to stop and it also made me deeply miss my GF. I tried to make her stop at first, I just told her it's time she calms down (jealousy talking) she didn't so I left her alone and let her do her thing, but I was still very jealous. This was the first time I was out and she was with me, so I don't know if this is how she normally acts when drunk. If it is then I really need to get my jealousy problems in check. Any tips or help that can make me control my jealousy?

I'd rather not specify anything about her. She was amazing, and I loved her to death. And she loved me. We dated for over a year. Back in May, without going into specifics, she had done something that forced us apart for good, and it related to religion (though it wasn't the only reason) Now we're in a complicated situation. We're not allowed to be with each other, but we still love each other. Honestly, knowing that she still wants me hurts more than if she didn't. I'm struggling to move on, and I don't know how. I'm making this post because I want to hear if there any other stories like this. Out of respect for her I don't want to get into specifics, but just as a general situation- how do I move on when I know she's still out there, wishing I was there? This is, or was, I guess, my first real relationship. It was more than just being there for each other. We helped battle each other's depressions, our problems. Nothing else mattered more to me than her.

Like I said we have been together for 5 years. He's 6'2 and around 266lbs. Thing is because he is so tall and built bigger he doesn't look his weight at all. With clothes on he doesn't even look too big just tall and broad/muscly. But he has a lot of extra weight on him. When I first met him he was the slimmest I have seen him and since then hes just been getting worse. There was one time he spent months getting healthy and he dropped a lot of weight but now he has put it all back on again. He also suffers from depression and for the last few months he has been at his worse so I know its not easy for him. It's just so hard because I know if he ate right and portion controlled and lost the weight he would feel amazing. I have tried getting him to see a therapist but he won't and I only just managed to get him to take anti-depressants He is showing no signs of wanting to lose it either. I feel like I am nagging him because I spoke to him once and told him how I felt and hes not changing. He says he will but then goes and eats massive meals. He gets annoyed with me and tells me I de-motivate him but without me there I think he would be even bigger! I am seriously worried for his health and our future. How can I approach this sensitively?

Well, I've been sick for almost a week now. Nothing serious, just a cold. Had a bit of a fever so I took some Tylenol for it. Throughout, my boyfriend has been going a bit gaga over me, making sure I'm okay, etc. despite my protests. He's very sweet, but I don't like making a big deal of it. Now, he seems to have caught my cold, and he's making a *huge* deal of it. He won't stop going on about it ""Oh, honey, I feel *so* unhealthy..."" and ""My throat is so dry and my head hurts so much, could you get me some water?"" or ""I just don't know *what* I'll do today. I'm just *so* sick."" He was supposed to come over to my place today to help me with some things, but I told him not to come, on account of him being sick and all, but really, I just didn't want to deal with him moaning the whole time. Am I being a jerk? It's just that, he's *never* sick, and frankly, I'm a bit jealous. I have heart problems which require monthly visits to the hospital, I get sick very often, and I'm just generally not the healthiest of people. So when he whines about a common cold (which he gets *maybe* once a year) I can't help but feel envious. I know that when I'm sick, he's the sweetest person ever, and he probably expects that in return, but should I really have to fawn over him and coddle him, and take care of his every need? I honestly just feel like telling him he's exaggerating and that I know he isn't feeling well, but he isn't dying either.

I liked him for 5 years. I know he use to like me but does he still? I first met and came to like him in the 3rd grade. He confessed to me. Sadly he moved away that summer and wasn't there for 4th grade. Then he moved back in 5th grade. He an I became very good friends. One day that year, he asked me out. Again. I said no because I thought we were too young. We kepted in contact with eachotger during the summer but eventually stopped talking. When 6th grade came, we moved to middle school. I want sure if he still like me. I had no classes with him. I started lowing hope very early. I thought that there were many other girls he could like. Then, during Valentine's day, he sent me a valogram (Valentine's candy we do at my school). He also texted me Happy Val. Day. Though he did that, we still didnt talk. In 7tg grade I finally had one class with him.I dint talj to him at all. I was too afaid. Plus I have a silent girl repuation at school. But anyways, he didn't talk to me either. He didn't do anything thing that year. I kik (ed) him once and my friend dare me to say hi to him once. Nothing happened. Oh yeah! I forgot to say something. I had alrwady tried to stop like him and like another guy. Guy #2 is now currently my best guy friend though. I have 1% amount of romantic feelings for him though. So that's all! Please tell me what you think I should do. I confessed to him a few days ago though.. do I regret it? I don't know.. Sorry for being dramatic...

There's probably a ton of reason why I shouldn't even bother with this but I can not help it. Here goes nothing.... Well, first off I'm a 23F and he's a 22M. Known him for almost a year now and we work together. ( I know most would say don't date your coworkers) With that said I'm also graduating in about five weeks and he's got another year left. I just want to know if he likes me and I'm wondering if anyone can answer this for me. I will try to describe our interactions because i find him impossible to read. When he first started working with me we did not talk at all. Over the past few months we have gone from talking about nothing to having normal non work related converstaions. About four weeks ago he started inviting himself to lunch with me but this only happens if we are the only two in the office. (We share an office with our boss and the last time he didn't come with me because our boss was there. I guess...) Most recently when i get on facebook i will have some missed message from him. Either something from here that makes fun of me or something about classes. About three weeks ago all my coworkers went out to the bar together and we ended up having this whole drunken convestion late that night about things we were going to do together later on. He told me that I wasn't vain or bitch like other girls and I think he tried to put his arm around me but he missed. Also, he was very close to me all night(Normally he won't get within a foot of me. Usually he will avoid any closeness) and wanted to know what happened between me and my last ex. Last week I was hanging out with two of my coworkers and one them made a joke about him being my new boyfriend. I don't know why he did this because I have not expressed interest in this guy to him and i'm pretty sure i haven't made it obvious. So i don't know if something was said or he was just being stupid.

As said before, my boyfriend [18] and I [18] have been dating for a year and a half. We are both party of a singing group at our school, which we have many gigs for. Today, Memorial Day, our group (20 of us), went to sing at the different memorial services in our area. The last place we went to fed us lunch, and around six of us were sitting at one table talking about psychology class. My boyfriend inappropriately brought up me self-diagnosing myself with OCD, which he promised he would never tell anyone (only two other people besides family knew). I had an anxiety attack in front of everyone. It's a very sensitive subject for me. I don't know what to do. I'm lost and feel betrayed. I haven't spoken to him much since and he doesn't seem bothered at all by it, or care about how what he did hurt me.

My girlfriend has recently went away to college and to make a long story short I have been nervous about her and her two new guy friends. One of them likes her friend and the other does too, but my girlfriend has said she feels jealous of all the attention her friend is getting. I went to visit her campus and her friend seemed nice but the other one didn't seem to like me very much, wouldn't talk much to me, etc. It could be because my girlfriend told them of the things I was saying to her, like accusing her of sleeping around with no real evidence. I feel like a huge asshole and have apologized tremendously. I have threatened breaking up with her before because it seems like she has been disinterested in the relationship through her text messages. But I understand that college is a new experience for her and she is busy with new friends and stuff. She also stayed at the one guys house with the other guy and another female friend and drank with them, after telling me multiple times she would never drink without me. I forgave her as I understand the peer pressure especially with her new friends She spends a lot of time with these guy friends but I have no real reason to distrust her as she only lied to me once about ""dirty texting"" her ex bf. I have apologized a whole lot and she always forgives me and knows that i'll come back around. We have talked about marriage and a future together and after all my anxiety and nervousness about her cheating she still says she wants to marry me. I am scared however that her appearance and self-esteem issues will make her validate herself by being a slut in college while she has me on the side to marry down the road.

Hello; I'm sorry beforehand if this is the wrong subreddit. So my story is basically the following: 3 years ago I met a girl. I'll skip the ""how compatible we were"" paragraph; but you must know that both of us are gamers and we play an online game. After a few months together, we broke up. Well, she broke up with me well knowing I loved her, but she still heartlessly broke up with me. Needless to say how down and depressed I was for the months that followed. And I reckon I made some mistakes by being jealous at that time of her guy friends. But Karma is a b**ch... Anyway, a few months ago I learn she got in a relationship with one of my friends. I knew that friend was a douchebag but who am I to interfere between 2 people? He slept with her -which was all he wanted- and the following day, in the presence of 4 of his friends, broke up with her in the most atrocious way: Cold-heartedly while adding insults. He still has an expensive game controller she lent him. Now, I know many would think she got what was coming to her. And so did I, for some time. But since a few days, a specific thought about her kept eating me inside-out: I hate her for what she did to me, for how she left me with that ice-queen attitude. I still remember it. But maybe she didn't deserve that. I swear to God, I'm a person that can hold grudges for life, but I genuinely feel sorry and pity her. Maybe after 2 years and half I still haven't gotten over her? Why is this happening to me? Why all of a sudden I keep thinking about her? Thanks for reading. Maybe I just wanted to share my feelings. I admit I feel a weight getting lifted off my shoulders after writing this. Really, thank you for reading so far...

My husband and I have been together for 10 years, married for 8 years. We've been through all the typical stuff all couples go through, and other things as well. Everything was pretty normal until he cheated with my best friend. I wanted things to work, so we went through counseling and it was okay for a few years. We had a child, and everything plummeted. He wanted me to be a stay at home mom and not work, but then would complain that I wasn't making any money. I could deal with his mood swings and anger, but as soon as he started swearing at our one year old, I left. We were split for almost a year before we reconciled. I believed he had changed and I didn't really want a divorce and put our child through that. Once back together, things were okay again for about six months, and then they have gone downhill. He doesn't want to spend any time with our child (asked to be played with and he will refuse because he wants to watch tv). He is controlling and manipulative; he threatened to take me to a pshyc ward after I confessed I was mildly depressed. He also threatened to cut me off financially because I wanted to get out of the house (with our child) for a few hours. I have so much of my life invested into this relationship, and being from a divorced family, I really hate the idea of doing that to our child, but I just don't know what to do anymore. Im not sure if counseling will help or even be worth it at this point.

My and my boyfriend have been dating for almost four years, and I remember when we first started dating it was almost like we were one and the same. We had the same interests, and we had the same views regarding sensitive topics ranging from abortion to the death penalty. Our sense of humor wasn't exactly the same, but it matched up well enough and we knew how to make each other laugh. That's how things were, and I was happy. But recently, I've been noticing how different our views are in other regards. For example, we have different political views. The reason why this one in particular bothers me is because I feel very strongly about my political stance and I actively research things related to it. My boyfriend does not. This isn't a deal breaker for me at all, however on occasion he will argue my views even though he himself does not know much about the side he is supporting. And whenever I bring up major points about my argument, he gets mad and either yells at me or ignores me for a while. Another example is that he doesn't agree with people getting a sex change, while I don't have a problem with it at all. Again, when we had this argument, and I brought up my points (I made sure to be civil), he got mad at me again and hung up the phone (but I forgave him this time since his family has been going through some difficult times recently). This has been my first relationship with anyone, so I know this may sound silly, but could this relationship still work even though we have different views on these issues? To be honest, I'm not sure if either of the issues I brought up are even issues that would cause a major divide in a relationship. For the most part, my boyfriend and I get along and we agree on many things, but I just wonder if these possibly larger issues might be a problem in the long run.

I'm sure it sounds ridiculous, but it makes me feel awful. He doesn't talk to his co-workers, he doesn't talk to classmates, he doesn't talk to anyone we went to high school with... he legitimately has nobody in his life but me, his parents, and his dog, and it's strange to me. I'm not a social butterfly by any means, I'm actually quite shy in my own right, but he makes me look like a socialite by measure. His life consists of class, work, the gym, and his Playstation 4. He occasionally goes for walks by himself, but when he's not with me, he's always alone and I don't know why it bothers me. He's not clingy or jealous or possessive or anything either. He doesn't have a Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, anything of that nature. He gets asked to hang out sometimes, but he ALWAYS declines. The other day some co-workers asked him to go to a sporting event to see a team he adores AND HE REFUSED! Instead of watching his favorite team play, he stayed home and ended up watching the game on TV! It really just blows my mind. I told him it's really weird that he's never spent the night at a friend's house or been to a single party. He's said that's just how he is and how he'll always be. I can understand not being BIG into it, but he has 4 contacts in his phone. His parents, his work, and me. Is that not weird? Am I crazy for wanting him to have some kind of social connection besides me? Hell, sometimes he'll even go 4 or 5 days without answering *MY* texts. I really can't wrap my brain around him and I'm unsure why it disturbs me so much. Any insight? We've talked about it a few times and he just says he really doesn't like talking and he can't stand most people, but I find that hard to believe. How can you just not like anybody?

So I guess this starts with my girlfriend's relationship to this guy. She was in this program for the last 4 summers where she would go out and prepare for a set of musical performances all over the country. Needless to say she got close to a lot of people throughout his process and as it turns out used to hook up with this one guy in that group. The tricky part here is that she now has this extremely close group of friends that will likely keep this long bond forever (they're all in a bit chat group that seems to go on forever). Again I'm pretty cool with that and even get excited when she tells me about the stories from her touring days. However, something that is really bugging me is that she seems to have this bit of contact with the one dude she used to hook up with still. I should also note that she has a past of cheating on someone twice in a previous relationship. So when I find out that she's in contact with this guy, I tell her how uncomfortable it makes me feel. One day he sends her a snapchat of him just smoking weed and I honestly just felt like complete shit because I'm wondering why there's still this bit of communication going on. I know they're still friends and that she's the one who cut things off but he still really likes her. I'm doing my best to not be too overbearing but it's mostly because I have no idea what to do in this situation. Today I saw a post on facebook with both of them tagged in it and it was a thread of them joking together and despite this being weird... It made me feel sick again. What do I do in this case? I get that they have a mutual group of friends and that they also have some sort of bond that I'll never fully understand... But on the other hand this kind of stuff is really bothering me. Is this a problem with my ego? Should I let this slide? If I talk to her what do I say?

My ex and I had a highly sexual and intimate relationship for almost a year. Anyway, we broke up because he said he didn't see a long term thing between us anymore but he admitted it would be a rebound if he jumped into a new relationship quickly. Well, he did jump into a new relationship quickly...with a 32 year old woman no less. However, he still comes to me to complain about her and talk to me sexually even though he is posting stuff with her all over social media, etc. Then, the other day he randomly suggested that I was going to ""make him cheat on her"" even though he claims he has never cheated before. Why do this? Why even get into a relationship with someone else if you're just going to end up wanting to cheat with your ex? Is it because he likes her more emotionally but likes me more sexually? It makes no sense. He knows I was heartbroken by him and have a tough time resisting our sexual attraction. I loved him but I feel guilty that I am both turned off and aroused because I still want him.

For the last 4 years we have always been really happy together, sure a few blips here and there but only extremely rarely. Just to give some background info she is a uni student and I'm in full time work. I see her going out, having so much fun with great friends, many of who are of the opposite sex (I'm okay with this but it does get to me sometimes) whereas I work in a job that's basically given me depression (my gf doesn't seem to care that I've got it) and although I have work friends, I'm basically kind of lonely. We see each other on the weekends but recently she just doesn't make me as happy as she used to, in her eyes the relationship is going great. She's picked up in the last couple of weeks that I've been down but doesn't seem ask me how I'm feeling. I know this is a wall of text but I would just like some info on how I can stop feeling so resentful and jealous of how happy my girlfriend is at uni whilst I'm depressed after work most days.

The Wedding itself was beautiful. Absolutely amazing, and it doesn't help that I am helplessly in love with this woman. Despite the problems that we've had, the most important thing to me isn't that the problems are fixed or gone. The most important thing is that we're both putting in the work to fix these things. After the ceremony, I was standing outside with the Brides younger brother, and he was confiding in me how jealous he was of his sister finding someone who she was so in love with. He then asked me about my relationship with my GF (the grooms older sister), and I couldn't hold back. I told him that I wanted to marry her, and that she was everything I'd wanted in a woman, and then some. She challenges me to be the best person I can be, every day. She picks me up everytime I fall, and she allows me to be there for her. In short, I cried, and feelings of relief and joy washed ALL over me. After much dancing, and a little bit of drinking during the reception (I had been hammered the night before; so I was trying not to get drunk) we all went to a bar for last call. I walked around a corner, and saw my gf's father, and walked straight up to him. ""I want to ask you for your daughters hand in Marriage"" His response was, ""We should talk about this later"" and now I'm FREAKING out. I'm of the opinion that the reason he wants to talk later is because it's a lot to handle. Your son is getting married, and your daughters boyfriend asks you out of the blue for your baby girls hand? I'd probably have given the same answer.

She is not one of those women who embrace HAES and think that fat and beautiful are not mutually exclusive. She gained weight in a very short amount of time and never lost it. In all other areas of her life, she is a confident, thriving person, but she has admitted that she feels insecure about her body. One night, she point blank asked me if I thought she was fat. I don't know if you'll believe me when I say this, but I know that she was NOT scrounging for compliments. I know some may say she shouldn't have asked the question in the first place, but she did, and that's not the point. I didn't know how to answer because she is definitely, undeniably fat, but I also know that she would not be happy with the truth as some people might be. She and I are very different heights so it's hard for me to estimate how much she weighs to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. If I had to venture, I think her BMI may be around 40 (and, no, she does not work out). I responded with total silence. Mortifying. I feel like shit. What should I have said?

So in short, there's a guy in my class who seems to be interested in me. It's mostly been casual small talk during class, with him asking me what classes I'm taking, where I live on campus, etc. But the other night he texted me asking if I wanted to go to a party with him. I responded something along the lines of ""I'm actually busy tonight. Thanks for the invite though!"" I wasn't sure how else to respond. It's not like I could've been like ""Um, sorry, but I have a boyfriend."" Then just last night, we had a group meeting, and he offered to walk me home. I declined and made up some BS excuse about how I had something to do before I went home. I'm at a loss, because he is being super casual and hasn't made it explicitly clear that he's interested in dating me or anything. But, I do feel like if he knew I had a boyfriend, he might not be casually hitting on me the way that he is. I'm not really attracted to him at all, but he's a nice guy and I think he's not be excessively aggressive or creepy or anything. Asking to walk me home just seems courteous. I guess my main question is, should I tell him that I have a boyfriend? And if so, how? Should I text him randomly and let him know (""Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I have a boyfriend. You're a really nice guy and I didn't want you to think that I was just being rude""), or wait until he asks me out again?

In my relationship I feel like I always have the first say, and that it pressures my girlfriend into saying what she thinks I want to hear, and I hate it (""If that's what you want"", as she says). Today I tried to get out of saying my opinion first and used something as an excuse to get out of answering it and then she accused me of ""caring about that more than her"" when in reality I wanted to see if she was willing to stand up for what she believed instead of just listening to me and making the relationship seem to revolve around me (she never seems to want to say her opinion first and always wants me to say it first and I don't feel like it's fair to her) She left my dorm angry and left me confused and upset. What do I do?

I'm probably overreacting. He doesn't mean any harm, but it gets extremely irritating. It goes through phases where everything's fine, but then the questions slowly begin. Here is a tiny sample of the most common scenarios. I leave the room: ""Where are you going?"" I get up: ""What's going on?"" I shift suddenly in my chair: ""Are you okay?"" I stand around aimlessly for 5 seconds thinking: ""What's wrong? Are you looking for something?"" I chop some vegetables: ""Why are you cutting them like that?"" I go out: ""Which shoes will you wear?"" He really isn't trying to invade my privacy or control me. Doesn't get jealous, doesn't care who I'm talking to or what about, doesn't care where I go (I.e., accepts ""Somewhere."" as an answer when I'm sick of the questions) He says he's just trying to talk, which doesn't seem quite right because how much conversation can you get from ""I'm getting up because I need to pee.""? We also have plenty of common interests which we discuss at length, so it's not as if I'm ignoring him. Any advice?

Hi I'm 15 years old and live in Sweden. I'm also in love with this girl (let's call her F) and we are in the same class. I've known her for 3 years and we have barely talked. I'm the average guy, not really one of the ""cool kids"" and she's one of the ""cool kids"". But our class is great, because it doesn't really matter if you're one of the cool kids. The thing is that I pretty much fucked up my most important friendships so right now I'm really unpopular, if you can call it that, in my class. Nobody talks to me aside from the occasional ""Hi"". Those friendships are another thing though and I just wanted to explain my social status I guess. Now for my status with F. I love her more than anything, and I know it sounds weird considering I haven't really talked much to her but I know exactly how I feel and that's how it is. I fell in love with F a few months ago, some weeks after I asked her out to prom. She kindly said yes and all was well. But when I fell in love with her is when shit started going down. I almost can't talk to her. I always thought that when people said that you can freeze up and simply not talk when you are nervous was utter bullshit, but guess what? That's exactly how it is for me. I can't think of anything to talk about and when I come up with something I usually stutter and get sweaty and all that. I even have trouble talking to her on SMS. And I'm really nervous for the upcoming prom because I think it's gonna go terrible. And I really want to hang out with her and become closer friends but how could I do that when I can't talk to her even? It would be easier to talk with her if we were alone but such an occasion would never happen.

I'm have recently begun dating a lot more and I'm looking for a long term relationship but I'm not looking for marriage or kids. The kids thing is not up for debate, but I admit that I could be swayed to consider marriage if it were strictly necessary for legal reasons and only if we were on the same page about the meaning of it. It seems like a lot of the guys that I'm dating - usually in their 30s - are looking to settle down. Eventually, the topic of kids and marriage inevitably comes up in a general 'how do you feel about it?' sort of way and I want to be honest. I tell the guy that I am childfree and that while I'm looking for a long term relationship, I don't really believe in marriage as a romantic/forever/happily ever after thing, so that isn't a goal for me. Every time this conversation happens, the guy's demeanor seems to change and it's like they don't take me seriously anymore. They seem thrilled with it, but so far I think that's just because they think it means I'm easy and that they won't have to commit. I'm afraid that it's sending the message that I'm just only looking to hook up, be fuck buddies, or that I'm someone they can just use and ghost on and that's not it at all. I am looking for commitment, but not in the form of a marriage certificate. I guess on one hand, it's nice to know these guys are assholes before I waste too much time on them, but on the other hand, this is really annoying and it's starting to make me feel cheap and like I'm in the wrong. I don't know - maybe I am. Am I going to have to suck it up and resign myself to marriage if I want to find a serious relationship? Is there a way to tell guys how I feel about it without making them think less of me and still respect me?

A couple of days ago, I made a post in r/needafriend. I received a LOT of responses but there was one person who I got to know that really, really peaked my interest. Not quite in a romantic manner but as a friend. Let's call him Dave. Dave was married and had children with his wife. He was not used to having women as friends because he knew nothing other than his wife. Dave was also in recovery. I can't share with what because I feel like I would be breaching a level of trust between us. Anyway, he decided to talk to his ""mentor"" about the relationship between him and I. His mentor had suggested to him that he doesn't feel he s in a position to be trying to build a friendship with me right now. He took his mentor's advice and said goodbye abruptly to me last night. I am at a loss because I feel like I've never had such a genuine friendship in my life. I feel heartbroken. I know I am usually the person who's giving the advice but I truly don't know what to do.

I have always been a kind of emotional guy, because during my childhood I went through a lot of tough social stuff. I was very overweight, thought I had friemds that I really didn't, and found myself being singled out just about everytime I tried to apply myself to friend groups and whatnot. I was always an outcast. No girls liked me until I slimmed out and began to get funnier and therefore mote social. It's for this reason that now I have someone who I have been with for 10 months, I still get the feeling that she doesn't really care that much about me, in the way that I like to be. She is very very busy with tennis, work, and our IB testing coming up in the next couple of weeks. I appreciate that she is busy, but sometimes I just feel like whenever we talk or hang out its because I pushed it or started it. She never really starts anything or texts me first. I find myself sending like 3 messages before finally getting a mediocre response at best. I know she loves me dearly and loves spending time with me, its just that we dont get yo do it very often, so I cherish the texting and talking, while she just kind of replies to questions I ask. Her parents are very controlling and she is busy, so we don't spend as mich time together as we want to. This stuff happens every day too. We usually have an off period together, but today she had to take a math test, so I just went home. She texted me saying that she was done, and there was still time during our off period to hang out, but when I asked what she was up to, I didnt get a response until the period was almost over. Even then, when I asked what she did and how shes doing, she didn't reply for an hour and when she did she just said ""a meeting."" Its just really frustrating for me that she doesn't cherish the little things, even when we don't get to spend too much time together. Am I overthinking this? Or am I being too clingy? What should I do?

I've been seeing a guy for 14 months, he can be great but he also can be horrible. For the first 8 months of our ""relationship"" he was dating another girl, that he told me was completely awful and treated him horribly which made me feel bad and I felt like I needed to take care of him. I've actually talked to the girl since they broke up and she's pretty great, he used her for money and for sex while cheating on her with multiple girls (including myself). I stayed with him because I believed that he really did deserve to be given a chance to be a real boyfriend but things continue to get awful. He hates my taste in music and is constantly talking down about all my favourite bands and artists, he also hates my style and mocks how I used to be fat (I'm recovering from aneating disorder, and this makes me break again). Things aren't just terrible though, when we're not having heated arguments where he's telling me that I'm always wrong and treat him terribly we're happy and we have fun. I almost left him last month for my best friend, that I've had feelings towards for years but I gave up any chance with him and just decided to stay with my current boyfriend but he ended up almost leaving me for his bestfriend's ex saying that it was because I could never genuinely appreciate his music and she did. We agreed on giving it one last chance because giving up 14 months seemed stupid, but all my friends were so upset with me for it because they find him controlling and rude. I kind of agree, but I can't tell anyone how things really are without having to face hundreds of I told you so's. And if you do feel like I should leave him, could you give suggestions on how to do it? I have bad anxiety and when I get scared that things are going to be too hard I go into a shell and back out of saying it.

Her problems have been having a negative effect on our relationship for quite some time. Her problem is general anxiety (diagnosed, has meds), but she thinks she's bipolar too. It turns into a problem because she becomes extremely insecure out of nowhere, about very irrational things. When she's not like that our relationship is great, but lately I feel like part time bf, part time mediocre therapist. So today, we got in an argument that stemmed from her being insecure. Tried to talk things through and at one point she admitted she needs help, but she's ""so bad she can't even go through with getting it."" I tried to reassure her that it's the best thing she can do, and can potentially help her rather then just live the rest of her life like this. Nope. She can't... even though she just won't. Am I being insensitive for finding this to be bullshit? I help her in every way I can. I just want her to get better, I don't want to break up...but my patience is wearing out and it's hard for me especially because my own life isn't exactly perfect. So is an ultimatum uncalled for? Get help or I'm out? What's the gentlest way to convince her to get help?

I'll try and keep this short and sweet. I've been with this girl unofficially for about 4 months now, and little did i know that when i started talking to her she had just broken up with her ex of 6 mo. We've been talking since and she has kept telling me she isn't ready for a relationship yet, and that she could see being in a relationship with me eventually but just not now. Through that i've been trying to be her friend, but of course my intentions are to be in a relationship and it shows. I'd have to say she just isn't really willing to acknowledge the fact that it is a relationship, as we talk nearly every night (when we dont fight) as well as hangout, and get physical. This leads us to constantly go through a cycle of fighting over what we define our relationship as. The great thing is that she is really good at communicating things with me. Which leads me to the other night, she said shes apprehensive about being with me because she feels like she can walk all over me, and she feels like she is being the man in the relationship. It's upsetting but when she told me, i realised how true it is. I feel like she's taken on that role because she has had the power to define what our relationship is this whole time, with me just being the guy thats trying to be her friend and wait it out for a relationship (since she isnt ready). So with that dynamic, how do i become the man and take charge in our relationship again? or better, what are some indicators of being the man in the relationship? Thank you.

Hi! First time poster and new to Reddit. I am new to the dating scene and wanted to get thoughts on first dates. I recently met a guy online and decided to meet up in person. I gave him my number and texted for a couple days. He suggested we meet for drinks at a bar. He lives approximately 35-40 mins away and he was driving to meet me around my area. He arrived first and got a table for us. I arrive 5 mins late due to lack of parking. He ordered himself a beer before I got there and the waitress was bringing it just as I was sitting down. I ordered a Jack and ginger ale with two limes, not a huge beer fan. We didn't order any food even though it was dinner time. He decline when the waitness kept checking up on us. We talked for about 2 hours and had decent conversations about jobs, travel, music etc. It was going well, however there was a lack of spark. Anyways, at the end of the date the waitness comes to see how we are doing. The guy asks for the check. The waitress asks if it's together or separate. The guy responds saying its separate. I don't usually go on dates, but is this normal? Is this an indication that he just wasn't interested as well? Note: I only sipped on my one drink and he had two beers.

We have an amazing relationship, as we are both best friends and great lovers. My only qualm with her is that she never talks to me about things that are bothering her. Often if I do something that upsets or annoys her, she will visibly show signs of it and refuses to talk about it. I ask her directly what I did wrong, and if she wants to talk, but she shrugs it off and often says ""now is not the time"" or ""I don't want to talk about it now"". For some time after (10 minutes, an hour, a day) she will be quieter than normal and we won't really talk or have fun. She is a quiet person in general so she doesn't like to talk about the problems or issues she faces, normally she just lets it go. However, I am the complete opposite. I don't mind going through arguing to solve a problem or to figure out why someone is upset. Instead of being silent, I will verbally communicate with her whats wrong. Last night she was doing this, I asked her twice why she was upset and she didn't answer. I knew she was visibly upset and I said that we promised to communicate better, but she just refused to talk. This made me upset, and I told her so. In response, she scoffed at me for being upset when she was the one who needed to be upset. This infuriated me and I tried talking to her again, but she just ignored my comments. This morning, we got ready for work silently. On the train ride she tried to talk about my plans for the weekend but I responded in short quips because I didn't want to talk. I brought up why I was feeling upset the night before and again she said this wasn't the time for it. This, once again, infuriated me, and we parted ways on the train to work. Am I overreacting? I know we have different styles of dealing with issues but I think for the sake of our relationship, she needs to open up more. I just hate knowing that shes upset and not figuring out why.

Hi Reddit, My sister has been in a relationshiop with this thug from my town on and off. Last time they broke up we spoke about it and we agreed he's not a good partner for my sister. She said he hasn't been that good to her and I gave her some cues on choosing the right guy for her but all for nothing because last thing they're together again and posting shitty pictures on FB.

It doesn't help I live far away from her. I talked to my sister and she said she will try again no matter what I said and will learn from mistakes. She's stupid but still my dear sister.

Throw-away since my gf knows that I reddit. Hello there, so my gf and I have been in a committed relationship for 9 months now. We're in a long distance relationship at the moment (far enough to have different time zones) and it will be like this for over a year at least. We've been in a long distance relationship for over a month now. We love each other and take our relationship very seriously. We don't really fight and whenever we have an argument, we apologize to each other at the end and become happy right away. I'm very happy with her. Both of us have very high sex drives and are open to share sexual fantasies. Being away from each other is a torture for us. So I suggested her that we start sexting each other for some sexy fun. Well, she said that she's uncomfortable with it and ""How in the hell am I suppose to say to my daughter or son don't sext or send nudes if I've done it ... How would you feel if your daughter sent nudes?"" So yea she's pretty mad at me at the moment lol. I don't want to force her to do something she doesn't want to, so I backed off. I have no intention of using anything aginast her if we happen to breakup, that's just a really shitty thing to do to any person. I thought it was because she couldn't trust me so I asked her and she said ""It doesn't have to do with trust. I just wish you would believe me."" Well so what do you guys think? Is sexting that bad? I see sexting as a way of having some sexy fun between two adults who love each other. Apparently she thinks it as a huge taboo.

I've been with my boyfriend for just over two years and he is the most wonderful, kind, caring, awesome person ever and I love him completely. But for the last little while I've had this nagging little crush on someone else, and it had gotten to the point where I would think about him and daydream about him a lot. I don't even know this guy, he's just someone in one of my classes, so its not like I even have any real reason for liking him other than looks and what little interaction we have in class. I realize now I should have just ignored these feelings and waited for them to go away, since this is very obviously just a silly crush and I love my boyfriend more than anything and I know he is the only one for me. But I made the mistake of telling my boyfriend about his crush last night, out of a mixture of maybe guilt and just wanting to be completely and totally honest with him. He got really sad and we just kind of held each other sadly and cried a bit until we went to sleep. He seemed to be doing fine this morning but I feel so awful now and I just don't know what to do to make this better. This has definitely cured me of my crush, I can't believe I hurt my boyfriend like that over something so stupid.

Hi reddit, throwaway. So my girlfriend has confessed she was raped five times by a friend's husband while living in Africa. She was six years old. She remembers it like it was yesterday. This hit me hard. I don't know how to cope with this. I love her and want to be by her side at all times. She is visiting Africa in a few weeks, and this man will be here. When she was molested, she said no one cared. Everyone knew, and the police didn't care. I have never been this angry. Her parents are divorced, and she lives with her mother. The mother is going to visit a close friend in Africa. This close friend's husband is the attacker (for lack of a better word). She has to go to Africa, she has no one else to stay with (can't stay with me) and will have to confront this man. What do I do reddit? How do I help her? She is my everything.

Heads up this may be a wall of text I'll try to make it as compact as I can.

At the time I was trying to help her with her bf at the time. Fast forward to today and I get a text from her: T: Hi Hamoflague I know we didn't part on good terms but right now I'm in such a bad way that the only person I feel I can talk to is you, you understand me and tell me the truth. I'm so sorry for everything, I've been thinking about you the past few months but didn't have the bottle to message you, I really need my old friend back. I'm the lowest I've been and I don't know what to do anymore. It's okay if you don't want to talk, I totally understand. But you know I'm not the type to say I need someone but I really need you back. (Me): Alright, I'll help you out as a friend but know that if you pull shit like that again and I'll make sure you regret it. Got it? I know you're bipolar but you need to get that under control ASAP Before anyone says anything yes I may have come off too aggressive with that but when you say a 2 year friendship means jack shit it fucks you up. I apologize for my potential aggressiveness and state the reasoning above and she responds with T: You know what don't worry about it. You've changed.

Relationship: M27, F28, 1.5 year duration. Our relationship was monogamous until recently. She has a non-existent libido and sex is usually uncomfortable or even painful sometimes for her. How often we have sex is often an issue. One day out of the blue she told me that it was fine for me to seek sexual relationships with other women. The only rules were that it can't be with her close friends. Always wear a condom, and never in our apartment. She doesn't want to hear the details of about it. The final rule being that she can change her mind later if she wants to know details about my sex life. She has this idea that I can just walk outside and I have to beat women off of me. That they all want to have sex with me and I've been telling them no. I ask why I think that, and she says it's because I'm very attractive. Which I'm not. I'm not ugly, but I'm not drop dead gorgeous either. I'm certainly not the guy all the girls fight over or approach on their own at a club or a bar. I told her it probably be at least 6 months minimum before I found someone, maybe even a year. She just refuses to believe it will take that long. Meeting strange women and charming them into bed was never a strength of mine. Everyone I've ever slept with has been connected to me already in someway. A friend, or a friend of a friend. Someones cousin. Something like that. I don't even know how I'd go about meeting a strange woman let alone charming her panties off. **How to approach telling them about my situation?** I don't even know how to bring that up. It feels wrong not to bring it up, like very unethical to not mention my girlfriend, but I don't know what to say. ""Oh, by the way, I'm already dating someone but we have an open relationship and I'm just interested in hanging out, being friends, and potentially hitting that""?

So I have this roommate.... -Nocturnal. -Never leaves the apartment except for class. -Plays video games, and browses /v/ all night long. -I know his brother is severely autistic; I think he is at least ever so slightly so. (Horrible at communicating, bizarre and obsessive interests, slightly delusional, but smart enough to be independent.) Roommate has a **fiance**... -They met 4 months ago. -He fawns over her, is hopelessly in love, would jump off a cliff for her. -He's never been in relationship before. -His parents have never met her, they don't even know he's in relationship. -She goes to college, works 2 jobs, very socially competent, has nothing in common with my low-functioning roommate. I have my doubts... -She does a lot of drugs (ecstasy weekly, weed/cocaine/acid occasionally) and has gotten roomie involved. He does not have as bad of a reaction as I thought, but I really don't think someone like him should be experimenting at all. -She frequently goes out on weekends without him, and quite possibly is cheating on him. -She completely calls the shots/wears the pants in relationships. To the point wear I'm embarrassed for him. -I'm not sure what she gets out of the relationship, but I get the feeling like she is taking advantage of him somehow. (I have no proof, its just a feeling.)

I've been dating my girlfriend for a little over a month. She goes to college about 6 hours away from me. We had both said it was inevitable that we were going to break up since the distance is harder than we anticipated. Last night I visited a friend at his college and we went to a party. I got very drunk and was basically just hanging out when a girl came up and started dancing with me. I knew I shouldn't have been letting her dance with me, but for some reason I let her keep going. Next thing I know she turned around and kissed me, and I kissed back. A few seconds passed and I realized what I was doing and stopped it. I feel like complete shit for doing it and I can't stop thinking about it. Now I don't know if I should tell my gf, considering we both know we are going to breakup in the summer.

So about a year ago, I met a woman who I instantly had a serious connection with. We got involved pretty quick, and we dated for a few months before she decided she didn't have time for a relationship, and broke things off. We went through a bit of a rough patch, and it sucked, but we have recently (within the last couple of weeks) rekindled things, and it's been nice. The problem is that in a year, she has every intention of moving across the country. I've known this for some time, so it's not a huge surprise or anything. My question is, do I continue to see this woman and enjoy the time we have together despite knowing that there is an expiration date on whatever it is we have together, or do I just cut ties and move on with my life and miss out on getting to spend at least this time with her?

The love of my life broke up with me yesterday. It was quite unexpected, but it was to get back with her ex before me. I suspected something wasn't right for a while, but the details aren't too important, and I may post it later but right now I have bigger problems. I have this huge project for work I need to complete for the end of next week (I'm working by myself, in a hotel in a foreign country!). I managed to do some, but as me and my now 'ex' (wow, that hurts), started getting disjointed I could focus less and less. This project's deadline can't me moved as it's huge for the company. If I mess it up I'm almost certainly fired. No one else can do it because I'm the most senior person in the company that specializes in this area. So Reddit, please help! I have days to work but every time I try I keep breaking down/throwing up/feeling dizzy. I can't concentrate, the heartbreak hurts too much (I know I haven't made too much of it but it's really painful). I have no one to talk to at this moment, but what's worse is I really don't have time for this. I realize I'll have to go through the break up stages eventually but right now this project is the most important thing in my life - but I can't seem to act on that.

My husband and I live close enough to his parents that we frequently visit on weekends. We have a dog and when we started bringing him with us I noticed that the dog would have sores all over his stomach, chest, and underarms. This only happened at the in-laws and never at our own home. I took the dog to the vet and after doing several tests the vet was unable to determine what the cause was, but they were very obviously bug bites. The dog was placed on new fleas and mite medication, but the bites were still happening when we stayed at the in-laws. Since I wasn't even sure what was causing the bites, I alerted my MIL so that she could keep an eye on her own pets. However, she waved away my caution because none of them have gotten the same bites. I even suggested that they spread diatomaceous earth (powder that kills mites) in the yard since they already have it and use it on their pets. That has not been done. Now, every visit since the vet visit I have reminded the family not to let the dog out unless he's on a leash to prevent him from laying in the dirt or doing whatever it is that he does to find these bugs. However, my MIL is constantly letting the dog out even after I have asked her not to. The bites don't appear immediately, but, lo and behold, the dog always gets eaten up and then scratches CONSTANTLY for the next two weeks. My husband always mentions how bad he feels for the dog after the fact, but he waves off my initial requests to keep the dog inside and says he'll be fine (obviously not). My MIL is always surprised by the bites, but isn't helping at all to prevent it from happening. I'm getting to the point that unless they listen and follow through with my requests I will not be visiting. I know it's *just* a dog, but I don't feel that my requests are overstepping any boundaries. I feel like no one is taking my requests seriously and then I get angry when they coo and feel so bad for the dog when I told them how to prevent it.

My best friend is Chinese and he eats very loudly. When we get pho or other kind of noodles, he'll slurp the soup and go ""ahhh"" after he swallows it. He'll also chew with his mouth open. I've been to restaurants with him and people will turn around to look at us because they can hear him eating. It's pretty fucking embarrassing. We've been friends for 10 years now. He's kind of a sensitive guy and I know it's going to piss him off if I tell him he eats too loudly. Plus I think it's a Chinese cultural thing to eat loudly and slurp soup like that. Should I tell him he's embarrassing himself by eating too loudly? And if so, what's the best way to do it?

We've been together for about 8 months now. I've a lot of fun with him and we work well together as a couple, but I just have this gnawing feeling that he isn't the right one. When I say the right one I don't mean ""the one"", like the one I'm going to marry or whatsoever, but sometimes I just feel like he isn't really what I'm looking for? Before this relationship I always felt like the type I liked were the intellectual type; those involved and interested in political and social issues and such. He's very much the opposite and rather apathetic about these things I care a lot about, which bothers me. Yet on the other hand, we have so much fun together and he's so good to me. Am I being too idealistic about ""my type""? I don't any relationship experience prior to this so I'm looking for advice from people who've been in long-term or a couple of relationships.

A bit of backstory: In april 2013 I came out of a 4 year relationship, this guy was my life and I invested way too much in him, I didn't know how to cope without him. Fast forward to summer, I slept around a bit, and finally met this great guy, expected nothing from it as he's way out of my league, but we ended up together. We've now been together 5 months and I've fallen in love with him, to my displeasure. I didn't want things to get too serious because I still felt vulnerable from my break up and I'm absolutely terrified of counting on someone to just have my heart broken again. My boyfriend, let's call him O, is really not good at communicating. He occasionally lets slip that he has feelings for me and feels rather embarrassed. I'm a poor communicator because I've built up these walls. From conversations we've had in the past, I know he's skeptical about love and ""doesn't do feelings"". Basically, I'm terrified that if I tell him I love him he'll freak out and decide it's too much to handle and consequently leave me. Take from this what you will, I said to him the other day, post-coitus, ""I'm really falling for you"" (i said this to gauge his reaction) and the response was ""oh, aren't you sweet"". I'm really none the wiser as to how he feels about me. So, reddit, my question is, should I tell him I love him, or is it too soon?

Recently broke up with my emotionally abusive boyfriend of 1.5 years. We live together in an apartment and neither of us can move until one of us can save money to get into a new place. It was a mutual decision (aka blowout fight) to end things, but we're coping in very different ways. It's been about a week since the final breakup. He's been out until extremely late for the past 4 nights and I only recently realized that he's been at the bar getting drunk. He made a comment about not knowing how some girls numbers got into his phone, to give you an idea how drunk he is. I confronted him and asked him to please not bring anyone home because I couldn't handle it and to please call me if he needed a ride. He responded by getting defensive and saying that I was the ""last fucking person he would call"". I'm afraid that he's masking his emotions with anger and alcohol, possibly wanting something bad to happen from his drinking and driving. He's got a history of depression, signs of bipolar disorder, and extreme anger issues. He doesn't know how to cope with anything. I'm literally the only one in a 100 mile radius that he COULD call if he needed a DD, and he's too stubborn to call me. How can I make sure he doesn't kill himself/ someone else by being an idiot and driving home drunk from the bar every night?

I'm in college right now but the only girl I have interest in going after is the one from my high school. I know it's only a crush but we have a lot of things in common and i don't want to just forget about it. I only live about 40 minutes away from my hometown so it's not like I'm across the country, I am home probably every other weekend. I was in a class with her last year and I would say hi to her and smile but really nothing more than that. I'm friends with her on Facebook but I don't have her number, and I think I could get it from a mutual friend but I don't know where to go from there. And I think just talking to her on Facebook one day would come across as creepy.. Is there any way to talk to her without being creepy seems how we have never had a full conversation? This situation is really aggravating me, the girls i've dated in the past were girls I saw everyday in school so I could talk to them and not be creepy.. What do I do?

My boyfriend and I have a fantastic relationship. We never fight or bicker about trivial things, but the fact that he has absolutely no will to start driving is bothering me. I have had my license for just over a year now - I got it soon after I turned 18 (the legal age for getting your license in my country). He is turning 24 soon and I can tell that he has absolutely no interest in getting his license. He did his driving test when he was 18, failed, and just never attempted again, after which his learner's license expired. I bother him about it almost daily, because I don't know what is stopping him. I understand that his parents are not in the position to buy him a car, whereas I was lucky enough to receive a car from my grandparents. I can imagine this to be somewhat discouraging but if he had his license he would 100% be allowed to drive my car whenever. I offer to teach him all the time. I still remember how my driving instructor taught me, and I'm not a bad driver at all. I feel like he is unmotivated because he is comfortable with me driving him everywhere. It's irritating because I drive us across town every morning and evening because I go to college and he goes to work on the other side of the city, and sometimes, you know, I just don't feel like it. Driving isn't exactly the most desirable task 100% of the time. Some mornings or evenings when I feel sick I'd like him to drive for once. Or sometimes when he needs something from the shops, I have to drive him there. Whenever I bring it up he says, ""yeah I should do that,"" but he never actually puts anything into action. I hate being rude or naggy to him, so this is getting irritating because I've been nagging him about the same thing for a year now. I don't know how else I can push him to actually make an effort, because I also feel like I am being selfish. I don't know ugh.

Just looking to get this off my chest and get some advice. M[23] about to graduate college had a FWB situation going with this F[21] sophomore who transferred here over a year ago. Same circle of friends, known her for over a year and initiated the FWB thing 4 months ago. Exclusive FWB from the start and neither was really actively looking for a real romantic relationship outside of our arrangement. I'm graduating in 1.5 months and now is not the time to get tied down in a romantic relationship. We would go on trips together and spend a lot of time in each other's beds multiple times a week. Great sex and openness within the relationship. At no point did either of us develop romantic feelings, but the physical aspect brought us much closer emotionally than we probably would have been otherwise. Out of the blue she gets a message randomly from a guy she was really into that previously graduated and lost touch with and they decide to have dinner. Long story short within a week we have to stop our thing and they're dating long distance, but he's completely inexperienced so she thinks things will progress very slowly. It's been a bit over a week now and we're seeing each other a lot and comforting each other when we are upset about the whole situation; (long hugs, rubbing each other's backs, hanging out alone and discussing things). We both seem to really be struggling with this, me a bit more than her since she has someone new to project it onto in a sense. A part of me really doesn't want to lose her friendship because of how close we got and she's a really nice girl, but there's a side that wishes we still had our thing going that is hurt by her choice. It's difficult to have her around at all because it makes me hurt, but I don't want to lose what developed into a great friendship. I'm just unsure how much of that friendship may diminish now that the physical side that helped it grow is no longer present. With only 1.5 months left, will most of that time be spend ""trying to get back to just friends"" ? Should it? Thoughts? Similar Experiences? Advice?

Before anything, sorry for my poor english, not native. I have been with my girlfriend for around 5 months now, I have never been so happy in a relationship. Since she lives kind of far away from my place (1hr with the subway), it's kind of difficult to see eachother a lot, because of our respective studies/works etc. That's why we would both prefer being able to sometimes go at eachother's place, so we can spend more time together. The problem in this situation is my father: whenever I'd bring some friends/girlfriend (I only brought an ex once and learnt the lesson), the only thing he would do would be bashing me (not that hard, but repetitively), telling really embarassing stories about me etc, to the point where even my friends/ex told me they felt quite unconfortable in those situations, as well as my older sister, who saw what is was doing to me and came to reconfort me. I have never been insanely close to him, and in these situations I generally loose all my abilities to respond and just close on myself. My father has a 'weird' schedule, as he spends one week out of two really away from home (like 10.000 miles away) to work, and my mother already met my girlfriend once when my father wasn't home, they got along well although it was a pretty fast encounter. I have two older sisters whose relationships never caused any trouble with my father (even when they were 16yo), one now lives with her girlfriend, and the other one's boyfriend comes at our place very often, again my father has no issue with that. I don't know how to handle this really, I don't understand why my father would have a problem with me dating, since he had none for my sisters, and I'm doing pretty well in my studies (in second year of a good IT school, and I already have a job for when I get out). I'm really afraid of any kind of confrontation with him, and I'm starting to get scared that it's me just being completely paranoid...

I've been best friends with this girl since high school. I recently moved back home and she has been hinting that she's into me (we flirt a lot touch, cuddle, makes remarks about us being together in the future etc.) but I'm reluctant to take it any further. Additionally, she dated my best friend, Andy, in college while I was out west. I love my friend to death but I know he is a negging asshole and I'm ashamed that she fell for him since I know how he is with women. (they eventually broke up because he cheated on her numerous times) I have an amazing opportunity to go out west in a couple months and haven't told anyone. I dunno why I don't want to tell anyone but if I tell her (we live in a very small town) everyone will know. I also don't want to lead her on knowing that I'll be gone. So not only do I have the negging asshole ex bf in the back of my mind I know I am going to move in a couple months. Should I try to pursue her and make moves or be real and tell her I am moving soon and only stay friends? We definitely have a lot of chemistry and I've always had a thing for her but I can't shake the fact that she dated Andy and that I'm about to move.

First of all I know we're young, but we've been going out for 3+ years. We don't live together. She left her snapchat account logged in on my phone and I saw a long list of snapchats to and from this one guy from her work who is 20, and there were a lot.. The snapchats also go on until about 2:30 am most nights, even on nights where she's said goodnight to me and told me that she's going to bed at around 1:00am. I'm suspicious because a couple of days ago she snatched her phone away from me when I picked it up and was really defensive with it, even though I wasn't even using it. She also acted really defensively when I subtly mentioned that I didn't recognise the username of her top friend on snapchat (who she sends the most pictures to) which is the guy from work. I really don't want to come across as jealous, but should I talk to her? I'm hesitant because something similar happened a year ago and I brought it up only to be told that I was being overly protective and jealous. To be honest this time around the situation is really suspect and I just want an outside opinion.

So, I'm considering puting her number on craigslist with an ad saying something like ""45 inch LEDTV FREE"" and then some BS story about how my (fake) son got a DUI last night and as punishment we are giving away his TV. Then have her freak out as her phone gets blown up with texts about a free LEDTV that she has no idea about. Now my girlfriend is a really good sport but in the past has taken her pranks waaaay to far before. I'm pretty sure when I tell her it was me she'll think its hilarious, thats just her sense of humor. I was wondering if you guys think this is a bad idea, not only for our relationship but legally. It's not anything sexual or really personal like her address (which from my googling tells me are the most common legal issues with a prank like this) so I don't see it getting me screwed over in the end.

Hi thanks for reading my plea in advance. To explain my situation, right now I have fallen in love with my best friend whom I have yet to meet irl. She was vacationing over here in California for a bit, but I never really had a chance to visit her because she was just visiting a friend and neither of us had a way to meet each other. She recently went back home to Japan and on flight there she had told me that she did not want to talk to me or else she'd cry in front of strangers. She had felt bad we didnt meet and it really tore me apart while also increasing my feelings for her because this has never ever happened to me and I did not know how to feel about it. We have tons in common, play games together, and watch tons of things via rabbit. It's hurt me more and more every time i think about confessing to her, but i really don't know how things will end up. It seems like she may be interested but the thought of a LDR might be a complete no go. So I ask, how would i go about telling her how I feel without feeling like a complete loser for expressing myself?

My on and off boyfriend (currently off, but we still act like we're together) are going through a tough time. I was unfaithful to him and he's trying to recover from it to make it work. We both want to end up together and he even says he feels we will, but he needs time. He's posted in craigslist's strictly platonic section before and has ended up on dates from women on there. This all happened while we weren't technically together but still doing things that couples do. He still tells me he loves me, kisses me and makes love to me. We're not ""officially"" together but many people think we still are because he'd rather not tell them, and we see each other all the time. I had an urge today to check if he posted on craigslist today, out of nowhere. It was just a feeling. I found a post that sounds extremely like him. I know his style of writing better than anything. I emailed the poster pretending to be someone else. He responded and everything he's said coincides with the guy I love's identity. It sounds EXACTLY like him.

Hey guys, I [22F] going to be the Best ""Man"" this weekend for one of my closest friends [23M], marrying a [23F]. Of course, that will involve a speech. The sensitive part is that he and I dated for a few years on and off back in high school/university. It was pretty serious at first (the first ""real"" relationship for either of us) and the breakup was pretty bad/messy at the time (~4 years ago), but we've since patched things up and remained the best of friends. His bride to be knows our history, of course, and all of his family and friends do, too. She seems super chill, though admittedly I don't know her incredibly well - he met her after moving to the other side of the country for grad school so she and I haven't interacted a lot, although we have met in person, played some Settlers of Catan, and talked a bit online. The wedding itself will be very laid back (< 30 guests, it's a potluck and everything). Anyway, the speech. Most of the wedding guests know that I'm the groom's ex, so I don't know whether it's best to acknowledge it with a joke, or if I shouldn't even touch that topic with a ten foot pole. Any advice? Is it disrespectful to acknowledge our past relationship in my Best Man speech even in passing, as a joke? I feel like it'll be awkward as fuck if I do, awkward as fuck if I don't.

So I don't want to go into a long winded explanation but the guy (21M) I'm (30F) currently dating, I have known for about a year. We started out as friends. Only in the past few weeks did we transition into something romantic. He's cute, smart, and most importantly funny. He has never been in a relationship before so he's pretty much going into this blindly. I don't mind holding his hand during the way because I've had experience with dating someone for a few years that was inexperienced in the relationship department as well. The ultimate problem is this... He loves my personality, thinks I'm awesome, beautiful and all that but it bothers him that I am considerably shorter than him, that I am sensitive/emotional to things, and my age. He tells me not to be so self conscious about these things but I can't help have that nagging feeling in the back of my head that things will not work out because of these three particular things. Now the whole sensitive/emotional thing I'm throwing out the window because I'm chalking it up to him not experiencing what being with a woman who is not a friend is like. I am more sensitive to certain jokes because the fact of the matter is... I am now his GF and some things just aren't appropriate any more to make a laughing matter. The rest (age and height) is something I obviously can't help. So basically, what do you guys think? Can this work out in the long run? I know he says not to make a big deal out of it but sh*t does happen and I'm trying to just protect myself here. Has anyone out there experienced this type of age gap where the woman is the older one in the relationship and how has it worked out for you?

**NOTE:** *this is probebly not the right sub for this, If you know a better one, please let me know. I am just desperate for advise..* Hello everybody, I am a 17 year old male, that is dealing with depression. I have been talking for quite a while now with a girl, about problems from both sides. We both have some real problems. I fell in love with that girl, but I know it is probably one sided. but that is not why I am here. Like I said, we talked a lot, via whats-app. At once she decided that she should not be affected by the problems she had. She moved on, and now she keeps talking to me less and less. If I ask how everything is going, the only answer is ""quite good"" or something like that. No further information. I don't know if she just doesn't wants to talk to me about it, or if it is really going good. I find it hard to believe, but I want to believe it. It however does feel like she is cutting me off. Giving really short answers to questions, and it doesn't seem like she wants to talk. Tonight she said she needed to go to eat, and has not spoken to me since. She is probably in bed by now. I just don't know how to deal with it. I want to talk, but she says everything is fine. I also don't want to force her into talking with me. As I said, I fell in love with her, because of the help she gave me. I can't lose her, I just can't. Does anyone have/had a similar situation?

There is this girl that me and my SO knows. I can't say I am friends with her because every time I try to talk to her, she downright ignores me. Like, literally. Every, single, time. But when someone else talks to her, e.g., my boyfriend, she is very friendly and would reply spontaneously. I honestly cannot figure out why she would only do this to me, we've not had any arguments or whatever. If I were my boyfriend I would've toned down my interaction with this girl just because how she has been treating my SO unfairly. This is the way I think- If someone is unkind to my SO, I can't be kind to that person too. But the way my SO thinks is that, if someone is unkind to me, that's between that person and me, and he has nothing to do with it so he can continue to be friendly with that person (so long as that person is friendly with him). Am I right to be hurt by this or am I just being childish?

I'm really good friends with a girl I met about a year ago. We get along great and I have to say this is the best friendship I've ever had. Apart from one thing. I feel like I'm always the one to make plans first. She accepts almost every time, but I feel like I'm always the one committing. I'm very well aware that this might be because by now she's used to me making the plans, me sending messages first and stuff like that. I've talked to some other friends about this and they told me that they thought I was in love with her (which im not, although I guess I'm close enough for people to think that). They told me that she might think the same and that's why she's not committing as much as I am. They told me to just back off for a while and let her show that she wants to commit as well, but I just hate the idea. I know she's very unsure about herself and I'm afraid I'll hurt her by taking a step back for a while. What if she doesn't act on it? What if she just thinks I'm done with her and is afraid to tell me? I'm just torn. Something tells me the ""taking a step back"" method could really work, but I feel like it's really mean. I'm afraid of hurting her (or even worse losing her) and I've always been someone who just talks about this kind of stuff instead of waiting it out. Everyone is telling me to back off for a while, but why not just tell her so we can talk about it?

My guy and I dated long distance for a little over a year. We stayed long distance until after our engagement began, at which point I moved in with him. Prior to this, the newness of the relationship began to wear off, but I thought moving in together would help. It did, for a bit. For months now, I have been struggling to rekindle the sexual and emotional attraction I once felt to him. I love him, and he's an incredible person and a very logical partner. Our differences aren't many, but enough that we can happily have parts of our lives that aren't constantly entwined with each other's. Separate hobbies, etc. I never just want to pounce on him anymore. I find myself feeling intense sexual and sometimes emotional attractions to others lately. I have drastically reduced contact with the subjects of those attractions and am trying very hard to consider my SO in positive light always. I also sense sometimes that he is doubting our relationship. He is not the type to share all his thoughts and emotions, so he is a mystery to me on these issues. In the last few months he has made the following two comments ""are you sure you want to marry me"" and ""I worry you'd be happier with someone else"" and I'm not sure whether this is an expression of insecurity because he's noticed a change in me, or if he just wants me to leave but won't say it. He's got strong moral convictions and in the past resorted to ""being the bad guy"" so he wouldn't have to break up with someone. What can I do to feel more emotionally connected and attracted to him? How can I feel more sexually interested? Am I being silly for worrying he has checked out? (I should note that his body and appearance has not changed, he is the same guy with improved emotional maturity now, and he makes more money now than he did before. No negative changes have occurred. Help!)

I have a very close male friend, we talk daily and have done for 12 years. He has always been there for me through everything and he is the best man i have ever known. Things were completely platonic for 10 years while we both had other relationships. However, he was single when I got divorced and we somehow ""fell"" into a romantic relationship, but for reasons which are my fault - it didn't work out. I was not ready. I could not commit and having sex with him felt wrong (at the time). I was so scared to ruin our friendship and got cold feet. He was deeply hurt and felt rejected. I tried to distance from him totally at this point, but he told me he needs me in his life and I have remained his best friend ever since. At the time we broke up, he told me I was not ready and that he would wait for me to be ready. But stupidly, I was unhappy that he still thought I was not ready nearly a year later, (he thought I needed time alone to 'heal' and 'get myself back to a place of emotional health') and so I decided to be a complete idiot and try to forget him by dating others. I kept finding narcissistic guys who lie to and cheat on me. He has witnessed my many attempts at terrible relationships and has been there offering counsel throughout. I have realised now that I only want him. Nobody else will ever measure up to him, but I friendzoned him in the most cruel of ways and I don't think he will ever let me back ""in"". How do I get him back?

Hi all. I need some help, obviously. I have two friends that I have the option to hang out with; my best friend, we'll call him James, and my other good friend, we'll call him Marcus. Marcus and I haven't really hung out in a while, and I really do enjoy his company. He's a really cool guy; and we share lots of common interests. James has been my best friend since middle school, and he is also a very cool guy that I like to hang around with. The problem is that both my parents and James' parents are divorced, so we only get to hang out every other weekend. James and I talked about hanging out, but we never really set anything in stone, whereas Marcus just asked me to come with him to his camp to go and ride kayaks and spend some time on the water. Now all this is fine and dandy, except for the fact that James can get a bit flustered if I don't spend time with him. Well, he's clingy. I appreciate him being clingy; because when he's like that, that means to me that he'll always have my back. Any advice or ways to approach the situation on either sides would be greatly appreciated!

My girlfriend and I have been together since we were both 19, we love each other a lot and have spoken about marriage a considerable amount, we talked a lot about building a family together, little did we know our first little one would come much earlier than expected. There was a lot of freak outs in the early months, both from her and I, her parents and mine, her parents wanted her to get an abortion but my girlfriend is pro life and so am I. I am ashamed to admit it but when she told me my initial reaction was to break up with her and not speak to her for a few weeks. A shitty thing to do and I felt like a complete asswipe looking back, just a couple weeks later so I decided for myself that you know, I have no fucking clue how to do this but I'm going to be a good father. We had some difficulties here and there, mostly early on due to my initial run for the hills moment which to this day several months later, it remains something I don't think I'll ever be proud of. I have to admit I'm excited to be a father but very nervous, how do I not screw this up, I don't want to be the dad that fucks up. I don't feel ready for this either, despite being excited and I just need some people to give me some support here, maybe some advice. We have a good sized apartment which I got from an aunt out of college and we live there rent free so that's one less set of debts to focus on, I never thought I'd be thinking about this at 24 but here I am.

Hey Relationships, hoping someone here could give me some general advice but specific advice would be great too. Recently me and my first love, longest girlfriend (2 years), and former best friend have been in contact and seeing each other more frequently. We broke up a few years ago due to distance as we were attending different universities. I have unfortunately redeveloped feelings for her. I have made these feelings known to her, and right now she said she would like to remain friends and continue to get closer. So here is the confusing part, I currently live in the city where I attended school and she lives in our hometown. I am extremely unhappy with where I am in life due to career issues and am becoming homesick. I don't have a lot of friends left here because everyone has moved for work, or is still in school and doesn't have the same priorities that I do. I have considering moving back to the hometown and finding other employment. Now that me and her are in contact again, I am afraid that is influencing my decision greatly even though I'm unsure of where our relationship will go. So I guess my question to you guys is, how do you know what you are supposed to do? How do you know what the right life choice for you is? How do you know if you're supposed to be in the right place at the right time for someone?

Hi, So for the past three weeks or so I've been seeing this guy and since it'll be a month pretty soon that we've been dating, I'm deciding if I want to take things further and get more serious or not. This guy treats me better than anyone I've ever dated OR had a relationship with. He has more respect, is more considerate, and we have a deeper personal connection than I have ever had with ANYONE. There is also more sexual attraction, though we haven't had sex yet. However, he has cheated on many of his past girlfriends. He told me this because he wants to be open and have good communication so that we can trust each other and have a strong relationship. He says that he's changed and that he never viewed any of those girls as a serious long-term prospect, and that he feels a tremendous amount of remorse and isn't proud of his past actions. He says that he's learned that cheating doesn't solve any issues in relationships and that he would never cheat on me because he sees me as someone he could end up spending the rest of his life with. He says he feels like he's finally maturing and growing up. I really want to believe him, but am I taking a big risk? He seems sincere and he DEFINITELY treats me well. I just don't know though! I mean what if he's said all that to ALL his past girlfriends? I really really want to believe him. Does he seem like he's actually changed?

Like 5-6 years ago, I dated this guy who really fucked with my mind. We were young, we thought it was love, and I thought it was real. The whole time we were together, he had cheated on me with multiple people. He enrolled into my university after a few months of dating, and there he would introduce the girls he was sleeping with as his ""new best friends"" and force me to spend a lot of time with them (otherwise I wouldn't get any time with him). If anything weird came up or I questioned him, he would gaslight me into thinking I was insane, because how could I not trust him?? He was a very chill person, and never showed anger. At the time, I really didn't know that he is who he really is. He gave me 'the clam' after sleeping with his roomate and told her I had given it to him, and to me he told me it was probably just dormant and maybe he had it all along (since he never visited the dr anyways.) We broke up over a separate issue, but pretty much he moved in with a girl he had cheated on me with (I did not know this until a few years later). It was such a dark time, I questioned everything and I still don't think I ever fully came back to how I was before with trust. On to today's problem.... Any time I get some sort of social media account, he messages me and if I don't enthusiastically reply, he tries to ""neg"" or joke about how I'm being ""rude"" and overall he tries to be playful with me. I don't want to have him blocked on everything, but most things he's blocked on. Last night he messaged me these stupid mind games on instagram, and I just blew up and told him pretty much how much how he fucked with my head and he just replied that it was years ago and I need to get over it. How do I cope? What do I say to get him to stop?

There is a girl that I have been friends with for over a year. I met her at the beginning of my first year of college and now in my second year we are roommates. I know she is bi and she knows that I may be as well. Recently she has started doing a lot of stuff that I would consider... flirting (I don't have a lot of experience with relationships since I have never dated anyone so I'm not really sure). She has started wanting to hold my hand a lot. When I am laying on my bed with my computer she sometimes comes over and practically ""spoons"" me to talk or look at what I am doing. The other day she said ""I like you a little bit, you know what right?"" I responded ""why"" and she told me I was a good friend. She calls me sweetheart and such and once I swear she kissed me on top of my head. She often, in her own words, ""nuzzles"" me. Once we left our other friends to go watch a movie but we didn't want to tell them that we were skipping out on the movie that they were watching so we didn't answer when they asked where we were going. Afterwards my friend said, ""they probably thought we were going to make out."" It doesn't bother me that she may like me... I'm just not sure I want to date her. Also I have never seen what she is like with her other really good friends so this could be normal behavior. I swear our other friends are starting to think the two of use are dating. I don't know how to approach her about it without it being awkward or ruining our friendship. I don't want her to think that I think she is just flirting with me because bi people flirt with everyone. What do I do?

I've been casually seeing a girl at my University (she's 20) for the past 7 months and I've been wondering whether to start bringing down my barriers and tell her about my problems. We've only begun to see each other consistently within the past few months and she's a great person, but we tend to stay away from more serious topics (or I tend to avoid them, anyway). The reason is that I may have lingering damage from my past relationship that makes me even more hesitant to trust others. I realize that she's has nothing to do with that, but the feeling is still there. The main hesitation I have is that there are some issues in my life (depression, ADHD, parents recently divorced) that might scare her away or alter our relationship away from what it is now. My goal is to try and be closer to her and show her that I'm definitely interested in her because I think I might come off as distant or indifferent at the moment. Should I wait longer before revealing these things or press on and hope that she sees past and can accept those things as part of me at this point in my life?

She doesn't want us visiting them and I always stick by her whatever she says. She tells me pretty hateful things about my family when she's mad, but we still visit my parents and siblings occasionally with the kids. * She says that she is done with our relationship every other week. It typically turns into her yelling, and telling me which of our two children she wants (and doesn't want) custody of. It takes about two days of stonewalling, hostile comments, rude remarks, to get through to her. I have to say nice things to her to get her back for days, and take a lot of hostility in return.

Some background, we have had a great relationship so far, right now we're long distance (about 2.5 hr flight) but in August we will both be back at our respective schools and will be a 4 hour car ride away. We both have a year left of school. She took a break from school in September 2014 to study abroad and then take an internship from January-August but will be going back after that. I am taking a summer internship close to my home. Our respective homes are a couple of towns over. At one point a couple of months ago, she started thinking she was a burden on me. I don't truly know why but I suspect it's because she doesn't have many friends in her area so she relies on me for someone to talk to. However I am not always available so I can't always talk. I do pick up and ask if I can talk to her when I'm done though. I love talking to her and we talk almost every night (Skype 0-2 times a week depending in the week. She's not a burden on me at all and no matter how many times I tell her she brings it up again within a few weeks. Yesterday though she said she was feeling really upset and didn't really want to talk for a few days. She didn't want to say why though. Later in the day she said she felt like a burden. We didn't talk at all today but I sent her a couple of text messages. I don't want to bother her too much because she doesn't really want to talk. She's flying over to me next weekend and I'm flying over to her for the July 4 weekend. After that we don't have anything planned until mid-august. We wanted to, but she's busy almost every weekend until then and she said it would be exhausting. My question is, how can I convince her that she's not a burden on me? Just saying it doesn't work and I'm really not sure what I can do from a plane ride away.

Ok so I've been dating my girlfriend for a little over 3 months now and while we've had our rough patches, (long distance, she doesn't live in the US, just goes to college here), I'd say we have a good relationship; we care about each other a lot and make each other happy. So my girlfriend, let's call her Jess, has this friend, Ryan, and they've been friends for five years now. They both had emotional issues growing up as teens and were there for each other through them so they have a pretty close relationship. Problem is, Ryan has been in love with her ever since and has always been trying to get her to date him, but she's never had reciprocal feelings. Once he found out she was dating me, he's outwardly told her that I ""get under his fucking skin"" and that he's incredibly jealous and always tells her he loves her and everything. Btw, he hasn't even met me. I trust her completely and everything, the issue isn't with her, it's with him. She always assures me that I'm the one she cares about and everything and I believe her, it's just annoying seeing him say all this love stuff to her when it's my job. It's her birthday next week and while she'll be with me for the weekend after her official birthday, he's doing something with her on Thursday and said that he's planned something for them. If this was a normal guy friend then honestly I wouldn't give it two thoughts. But I know, based on the way he feels, that he's planning on doing something really mushy (for lack of a better word). I just feel like the ""mushy"" stuff should be left to me, not having to share with some other guy like this. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? I've told her multiple times that it's just a weird relationship, and I wish she would set some sort of boundaries or something, but she always assures me that I'm her boyfriend for a reason, which I do truly believe. It's just annoying to have to deal with another guy like that.

On my phone, please forgive grammar and spelling errors. Alright I can't believe I'm even asking this, I'll make it short. I've been with my boyfriend for a year. We have a great relationship although admittedly I suffer from some body image issues. I think I'm actually fairly attractive, fit, successful, and intelligent - but for some reason I have these feelings of inadequacy because of my bf's perpetual habit of following and liking photos of provocative Instagram models. Sometimes they're famous and sometimes they aren't (i.e. only a couple hundred followers). He's from LA, but he now lives in the Midwest where we met, where I guess you could say people are surrounded by women like that all day. Every day, in the morning when he wakes up, at work, at night, when he's with friends, when he's next to me, he's always following and liking all of their photos. It's just Instagram so I try not to care but I can't help it! I feel like he's borderline obsessed. I don't know if my feelings of hurt are warranted.

I've been talking a lot with this old acquaintance from my home town and the conversations are clearly flirty in nature so I have a pretty good idea of where this is going. But the problem with this guy's friends circle is that they're all the same people I used to hang out with in high school. His brother used to be my classmate, in high school I briefly dated his best friend, we all hung out in the same basement every weekend, etc. They're not bad people, but it was a small town and you're sort of pushed together with these people because of the circumstances surrounding you, not necessarily because you'd choose them as your friends. When I rarely hang out with them (some sort of social obligation I guess), it's still all the same jokes and all the same topics as in high school. Honestly, I sometimes feel this incredible urge to just delete all of them from my social media, because I don't really want them to know what I do or how I'm doing. These people never made me feel good about myself. But I do like this guy. I had a crush on him for years, he's funny and hot, part of me really wants to see where this could go. But part of me also knows that hanging out with our old friends would just mean a lot of juvenile humor, smoking weed, lots of gossip, people making ""good-natured"" jokes about various minorities, etc. I don't really care for that but I know these are the people he spends the majority of his time with. Is there a way to date this guy but not really interact with my old friends? Or am I an asshole for even having this problem, I mean is this thing even worth pursuing?

A part of me knows that we've never been right for each other. My parents don't like her. I don't like her parents. I'm serious, I like books, I like movies and music and videogames and art history and pop culture. I'm lazy. She likes to walk, she hates watching movies. She likes to travel, she's never played a videogame in her life. Her music taste is determined by whatever the radio is playing. We don't talk when we're alone together. I'll roll us a joint and we'll watch a tv show until both of us fall asleep. I'm incredibly lonely, despite the fact that we've lived together over two years now. On paper, we're incompatible. But we've made it for five years. Part of me thinks it's almost entirely based on sexual attraction. She likes the way I look, and I like the way she looks. Every other part of our relationship is strained. The problems: all of our friends are the same. She would be crushed if I broke up with her. I worry that I would regret it immediately. That I would realize right away that I was wrong, that we were actually right together this whole time and I threw it away. How can I think like this? Why am I so convinced that we're both utterly wrong for each other and that I would be an idiot to throw her away? Even more problematic: we have amazing nights together. Every once in a while, we hit it off, and it feels like I'm falling for her all over again. I've told her, many times, that I've always wanted to marry her (truthfully). But then the next morning comes, and we're the same lifeless, boring couple we usually are. Can someone just talk to me about this? I hate this feeling. I'm terrified that she's really the one for me and I'm being idealistic thinking there's someone better out there.

Hey, so I've decided I need to break up. I hate break ups. I wasn't sure about him to begin with but I thought I'd try it out. He's been mostly good, but I definitely no longer want to be with him. I don't want him touching me etc. he has a problem with boundaries. Eg. Wednesday night he came to my house at 1.15AM to see me. Knocking on my window/wall till I came outside. I hadn't checked FB so I didn't know he'd been trying to contact me (issue w his phone). Overreaction on his part and it stressed me out. Today he tried to call me 6 times in a row over a 20min period. I feel like he's stalking me and won't leave me alone. I haven't seen him since Thursday. I have no desire to catch up or do anything with him, however, I need to break up with him. I need to do it in person, I don't feel like it's something that should be done over the phone. It's making me feel anxious when I think about him/the situation. That being said I liked it when we first started going out and when we were just friends. At some stage in the future I'd like to hang out as friends. Given that he is kinda obsessed with me and really intense (tells me that he loves me and wants to marry me and have kids with me etc.) do you think this us possible?

I'm 24(F) and he's 27. I just moved into a really small town a few weeks ago. I met this guy through a friend of mine that doesn't live too far from here. I immediately felt attracted to him as soon as we met. The attraction stunned me. It kind of shut me down. I just don't know what to say half the time out of fear of sounding stupid... which is ridiculous because that's not me. I'm usually an outgoing, pretty talkative person. It's been a while since I've been in a relationship and it's like I've lost how to deal with the whole flirting, chase, whatever happens pre-relationship. I know he's interested in me because he's complimented me many times, asked me out on dates and we've kissed and cuddled. although, he leaned in to kiss me goodbye when I was leaving the other day and I kind of just got really nervous and walked away.... leaving me feeling like an idiot for doing that. I'm interested, but I also don't want to seem too interested since we're just getting to know each other. Expressing my feelings towards someone is a hard thing for me to do. I know he knows that I obviously am somewhat attracted to him or else we wouldn't be cuddling and kissing but how can I get over my awkwardness? How long can I get away in this shell I'm in before he decides he isn't into me?

My boyfriend and I live in different cities, and generally see each other for 2 days every third week. I moved to my city to attend university, so I live temporarily with family and move back with my parents during the breaks. Because of this, I will be going home for 1 month starting tomorrow. My hometown is a 14 hour drive from his city. While I'm back at home, my boyfriend will be going overseas for 15 days with his family. We've established that we'll likely not be able to talk everyday, and it'll be another two or three weeks before I get a chance to see him again. I'd like some advice on how to deal with missing him. The problem is that my parents are constantly working, and my brother works long hours, so I won't always have someone to distract me. I'm looking into getting a job while I'm there, but night time seems to be the hardest time. Any advice would be appreciated.

There's a new girl at our school, who is in 2 different classes with my boyfriend. She sits next to him in one of them and over the past couple months they've become friends. They talk during class and outside of class they text pretty often, but they've never hung out outside of school. I let him text her and stuff, but I'm hesitant about them hanging out with each other. When I first found out about their friendship, I messaged her on Facebook in a non-confrontational way letting her know that he was my boyfriend and that I don't want her flirting with him or anything. She said their friendship is completely platonic and that she was aware that he had a girlfriend, she seemed nice and everything and everything was fine. Then a few weeks ago she texted him while I was with him, I texted her back as him and carried on a conversation to see how she talks and what she talks about to him and if she tried flirting with him or anything. Later it came out to her that it was me texting and she tweeted something about jealous girlfriends, I asked my boyfriend to talk to her about that and next thing I know, her twitter is set to private. I sent her another message on facebook but she didn't respond. Today she asked him if he wanted to hang out after school (tomorrow) and he said yea, and he told me and I said don't you think you should have asked me first, and we got into a bit of a fight. I hate what this girl has been doing to our relationship, we rarely ever had arguments until this stuff came up and I don't know how to handle it. He thinks that he's hanging out with her tomorrow, but I don't want to let him. At the end of our fight I basically said whatever then go hang out with her. I don't know if he's actually going to or not but what should I do?

Jasmine has been my good friend for a long time. She is a self proclaimed commitment phobe, had never been in love, loses interest in guys she dates FAST and is infatuated with Michael. Michael is a really quiet guy. Up until recently I thought he was a nice enough dude. Whenever we talked previously it was just ""how was your day"" etc. I have noticed however that he has a short temper and tends to say mean comments. For example, a couple of days ago another housemate made a comment about disliking a particular song Michael liked. He paused a bit and then said vehemently ""well then you're just a fucking idiot."" There was a really awkward pause and everyone got quiet save for a few ""whoa...""s. Jasmine wasn't present for this. Jasmine has been really into him lately and has been telling me how ""deep"" and sensitive and intelligent he is. How whenever they talk they have such great insightful conversations. She thinks he's different and may be ""the one"" because no other guy has ever made her feel like this before. She's still on the fence about dating him and she says he's the first person she's been actually into for a while. I can tell she's very excited about the prospect of dating him hence my hesitation in telling her my thoughts. She knows he has a temper and says its ""hot."" What the hell do I do here? She's very independent and anything I say she will probably do the exact opposite. I previously thought he was a chill guy and told her to go for it and now I think that would be a big mistake.

Two years ago this September my dad decided to leave my mother. It's been incredibly hard on my four siblings and I. It nearly destroyed my mother. She's gotten stronger everyday, but we're still right in the middle of an incredibly ugly divorce. I've gotten past the point where I'm sad all the time, but it's still very hard. Throughout this process I have had my boyfriend of 4 years. He has been amazing and wonderful, and always there when I need him. I know this has been hard on him too, because we are both close with each others families. This brings me to three days ago, when my boyfriend's father dropped the bombshell on his family that he has been seeing another woman and will be leaving them. His whole family is being destroyed in the same exact way mine was nearly 2 years prior. You would think I would know exactly how to comfort my boyfriend but I don't. I felt angry and upset at first, but now I feel weirdly detached. I almost feel scared of going through this entire process again. And even though he was there for me every step of the way, I am afraid I can't be there for him. A part of me doesn't want to go through the hurt of my family being broken apart again. Because I know exactly what the next 2 years look like for us now, and it's bad. And I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. To clarify, I am not leaving my boyfriend, I love him with all my heart. I just want to know how to get rid of these fight or flight feelings.

Hey all. I (26f) met a guy online (27m) pretty recently, and we REALLY hit it off. We were texting all day everyday. He would write long, super cute, descriptive texts everyday.. All day long. I loved it since I really enjoy texting. We would talk on the phone at night before bed, but texting was absolutely our #1 communication. We met in person last weekend, and things went really great. He even invited me to go up to his lake house this weekend with him, which I am absolutely going to do. We leave tomorrow. But... Since we met in person, his texting style has totally changed. He still writes me everyday, but nothing like he did before we met in person. He sends me much shorter texts now, that are not nearly as cute as the ones he started out doing. It makes me feel really bummed and has me questioning if he's still into me like he was? I asked him if he was still ""into me"" and he told me that his feelings have remained the same and that if anything changes with the way he feels towards me, he would be honest and tell me. But I can't help but feel like they've changed. His texting now compared to before we met is like day and night. It's completely different and almost distant. I really liked the way he texted with me before we met. I haven't brought this up to him, cause I don't want to look like a weirdo. But I was just wondering what you guys all thought about this? Has anyone had a similiar experience? Should I just take it as it is, and not bring it up? Does it sound like he's just not that into me, even though he claims he is and has invited me to hang out with him this weekend? Thanks all.

[Post from 2 month ago]( Im dating this girl who is married, she said that things in her marriage are not working since more than a year ago. That it was a mistake and she married too soon. Her husband (27 M) cares for her a lot and provides everything for her, but she said that she just doesnt love him and wants to be with me even if that means she has to get a job and have a more humble life with me. Well thing is: I can't stand it anymore, I truly love her but Ím killing myself for real. I just can't stand the idea that she has to share bed with him eventhough she told me that they have not had sex nor kisses since before we met (can't confirm). Its the fact that she is the reason that her marriage is not working that is killing me. She even said that if she wanted they could fix their marriage but she cant do it because she is not attracted to him in a any way. Im not her first affair, Im the 3rd (4th if you count a girl u.u), she promised me that she would not cheat on me if we end up together because I am all she ever wanted. But oh man, its my brain against my heart, I really love her but Im afraid Im just blinded by love and the she would do the same to me in the future. I really respect marriages and hate doing this both of them, yet I dont wanna lose her. My friends said that Im feeling this way because she was my first and only sexual experience, that I should just let it go and find someone better, but I dont think Ill find anybody that understands me as she do.

Hello r/relationships, I used to be really close to this girl, let's call her Beth, and we did everything together. We got close for a few months, before I started to really get to know the true Beth. She was a slob and I felt disgusting in her apartment (piles of stuff everywhere, never showered or did laundry). I read once that as soon as you think someone is gross, the relationship is over. She also was ridiculously clingy, especially during finals or when I had huge amounts of homework. It got to the point where her presence would stress me out, because she would distract you or need attention even if we were working on homework. The straw that broke my back was that she had a lot of emotional drama with another friend of ours. It would consume every single conversation that we had, and I would give her advice, she would do the opposite, and then get mad at me. She would often accuse me of trying to get between the two of them and causing drama (which in fact, was her fault). I would get yelled at for talking to the other friend if I didn't consult with her first. It was draining, stressful, and I had to devote a lot of time to walk on eggshells around her. So anyways, after the semester ended and we wouldn't see each other, I decided to put some distance in so I could relax. We did not really talk much, or she would text me odd things and I wouldn't feel comfortable replying to them. An example is that she texted me saying she had a dream about sleeping with me and my boyfriend and she thought it was hilarious, and I thought it was odd. Fast forward to today, she texted me yo bitch why don't I ever hear from you anymore? I did not reply because I know she's fishing for drama. But I am wondering if I owe her an explanation? She continued to snap chat me over and over when I did not reply to her text.

Please excuse any errors this has been a *wonderful* night. :) Basically my dad is a piece of shit and always has been. My mom ended up marrying him which was a bad decision but he promised he would change. From the time I was young they would scream at each other and even get physical. It hasn't been like that in a long time. Tonight he came home and screamed at all of us, called my mom names in front of me and my brother, and even pushed her. I called the police and they didn't remove him because my parents are married. I said ""He will destroy our stuff if he stays..."" (Because he has before) and they said ""It's his house too."" So basically they told us to fuck off. They said if we want to leave we can or we can go to a shelter. S/o to the police for their help!!! :o) Basically what I want to ask is what can we do. My mom wants to leave but she doesn't make a whole lot of money, and I'm not working because I've been focusing on graduating. We don't have any money saved up because we are dumb and blindly trusted that he had changed. All of our family lives out of state. She has a car that is in her name but idk if he can take it or what.

About 2 months ago, I (f,23) ended a relationship with my boyfriend (m,24) of 9 years. It ended for a lot of reasons, but mostly because of how bad things had become between us. For the past year, I have had a crush on one of my best friends. Although I liked him alot, I would have never allowed myself to cheat on my boyfriend although there were a few times where it could have happened. I started to like him more as time went on, and could tell he liked me as well, but nothing ever happened while I was with my boyfriend. Only a day after I break up with my boyfriend, me and him ended up hooking up after a night of drinking. Neither of us said much about it but we agreed that we should wait before hooking up again since I had just gotten out of this 9 year relationship. Despite us saying this though, we still find ourselves drinking together and hooking up roughly every couple weeks. It has now been two months and although we both agree we shouldn't be hooking up, he keeps initiating. Every time he initiates, I don't stop him because I always want to just as much even though I know it's best if I don't. He also got out of a long term relationship not too long ago so neither of us are ready for a relationship. Since we are close friends, we are still hanging out often like we were before but I am wondering if I am making a big mistake by continuing to casually hook up with him. He told me that he really likes me, but since he is still dealing with his break up and so am I, he feels that we can't jump into a relationship because we would mess it up and he likes me too much to do that. I don't know if he was being honest when he said this but, I know he is right about neither of us being ready. I like him a lot as well but feel like I need time to be single. So far we haven't been able to go more than a couple weeks without hooking up. I feel confused and am unsure what to do.

So, I have been dating this guy for over 6 years. He is 29 and I am 25. We are both openly bisexual and have been for the duration of the relationship. He claims he likes to look at other men and is sexually aroused by them but does not like to be in relationships with them because they don't understand him like women do, as he is a bit feminine. We recently had a baby together and, though we have always had different sex drives, it has gone from not enough to pretty much nothing. I know that the new baby is a factor, but I am concerned it could be more than that. He comes from a very religious family who believe that homosexuality is wrong and gays go to hell. His mother also has put a lot of pressure on him to get serious with a woman and start a family. Since having the baby he has seemed extremely disinterested in me sexually and has been talking a lot about the guys from work. He has also been staying late a lot and getting home at odd times. I am worried that, now that he has a child, he feels like he has fulfilled his mother's wishes and can start thinking more about what will make him happy. I have tried talking to him about it, and he always says that no one could understand him like I do and he wants to be with me. That's great and all, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that he does not find me sexually attractive b/c he prefers men. He is always worrying that I am going to go back to my mother's house and not let him see his daughter. Having grown up w/o a father myself, I would NEVER do that to my own daughter. I love him very much, but I am miserable and feel unwanted and I can't stay in a relationship that is a lie. Is there a way to get to him to open up about this and be able to tell if he is not lying?

So I started dating this girl who is fantastic, in every sense of the word. She is wonderful, caring, funny an just about loves an adventure when it comes to anything new. I couldnt ask for anything better. When we go out or at my place I cant seem to not enjoy time with her. But I cannot get this thought out of head that I can do better. I am talking about her physical appearance(overweight, desirability). For all the girls I've dated, she really does seem to get what I say and how I say it. Sure would not like to fuck things up. Yet I cant seem to say this to her in as many words. As much as I want personality and character over beauty, I sure do think being easy of the eye goes a long way. Should I break this to her ? What are the subtle hints that I give out ? Is it even okay for me to expect her to change for me ? This is also coming from a deep rooted sense of my personal insecurity where I jinx relationships by finding out flaws when it is going well. Every single time, I seem to seek out things. I really would like to talk to her about it, but it might be a bit too early. I like her a lot and would not want this personal struggle to be projected onto her. Should I get my shit straight before I go any further ? Please do know, I DO NOT mean this to be a shallow, skin-deep post. I truly want to express desire, lust. Yet I am unable to.

I am from a southeast Asian country. I recently got a scholarship and moved to a european country for my education. I really love this place. I love the freedom that came with it. For the first time in my life, I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. Back home, I used to live with my family. Now I am all alone and my own boss. The problem is everyone in my country thinks going to europe is a big deal. If given the chance, everyone will move there. Which leads me to my uncle, who really wants to live and work in europe. Now I have no problem with him living in any country but I dont want him to ruin my freedom. I want to live here alone and dont want anyone interfering in my matters or reporting my stuff to my family. When I came back he was asking me a lot of questions about europe and said that he will come to live with me there. I did not know how to react and told him that its really difficult to get the visa of my country and he should try Canada or Australia. He said ok but I have a feeling he will ask me again or someday I will receive a call that he is coming to stay with me. He is rich and he can get a tourist visa for my country which can then turn into long term residence if he gets a job here or starts his own business. Which means that I will be stuck with him for a long time. How do I politely tell him that I want to live alone and him staying with me is not possible? Should I say something like ""It is not possible now, maybe you should wait till my education is over"".

I'm considering ending things with my girlfriend, but I can't bring myself to do it. Here is why I'm considering to end things: Lately (the last couple of months) we don't talk as much as we used to. We only have sex a few times a month. I feel like I've lost interest in her. She says she loves me everyday and it feels like I'm lying to her when I say 'I love you too'. I know that in the long run we don't want the same things in life. I still care for her a lot and I think I love her which makes the decision very hard for me. I can't help but feeling guilty for not being honest about my doubts about our relationship. I can't make the final decision to end things because every time I try to actually have the talk or just think about it I begin questioning if I'm doing the right thing. I've had these doubts for several months now and I feel bad for ""wasting her time"" until I make up my mind. Every time I think about breaking up I remember how much I care for her and how cute and lovely she is. So I guess my question is how do I know if it's really the time to break up when I still have feelings for her? I haven't said anything to her about my doubts as I want to be sure about my decision, so I wont hurt her needlessly. I hope some of you can give me some advise or thought on what I should do.

Evening ladies and gents, I have been together with my girlfriend [19F] for about two years now. I love her very much and she is an amazing person, we're very close. Problem is, we go to separate universities about 2 hours away. Our first year went by alright, we managed to get through it. However this term, another girl in my program has been catching my attention. At first I just shrugged it off as who isn't attracted to other people? But it's been almost 4 months and I'm still infatuated with her! I would never do anything to hurt my girlfriend, and to make things even more complicated, she has a boyfriend as well (though he's kind of a douche). We don't talk often, but when we do we share this connection that I know she feels too. My program as two school terms followed by a work term, so my girlfriend and I will likely not be able to see each other for a long stretch of time for many years to come. This girl will be there for the whole thing (if neither of us drops out). My work terms coming up and I probably won't see this girl for 4 months, and possibly not even my girlfriend. I guess my problem is, if I'm feeling like this now, should I break it off with my girlfriend since I don't seem to have such strong feelings for her as before, or should try to hold off? When I don't see this girl at my university, I feel a strong connection with my girlfriend like I used to. But the second I catch a glimpse of this other girl, I can't think straight and she's on my mind for the rest of the day! I'm really confused here Reddit! Anyone have any advice that could be helpful? Thanks in advance!

Hello everyone, first time posting here :) I started working at an office about 7 months ago, and about 2 months ago, my 33 year old coworker started to flirt/talk dirty to me whenever she sees me around. I've always had a thing for older females. To my memory, I've only ever liked females that were older than me. I can't tell if she's serious or only joking/seeking attention, because she usually only flirts with me when another coworker is around. If it's just me and her, she usually doesn't flirt. I didn't like her when I first started, but I guess her flirting is working on me because I'm starting to catch feelings for her in a sexual way (I'd be down being her fuck buddy). I get the feeling that she's only being playful with me because outside of work, she doesn't really put in an effort to socialize with me via text, etc. My other coworkers joke around and know that I've been trying to pursue my 33 year old coworker in a semi joking manner. (She's told me that she'd only be down if I were 28). Should I stop before things get too far?

My girlfriend and I are sexually active and she is on BC pills. The other night I decided to finally bring up the topic of ""just incase, what do we do"" because I know no matter how much BC is used there's always a chance. I really wanted us to be on the same page so bad regarding that. I think an abortion before a certain period within pregnancy is completely acceptable and I support it if the couple aren't prepared to have a kid, she is apparently very anti abortion. She said in the case of pregnancy she is keeping the baby whether I like it or not, despite admitting several times that it would drastically affect her life negatively and despite saying that she is no where near ready for one. This made me very uncomfortable honestly and I don't know how to move forward with this. Part of me feels that it's important we be on the same page on this before continuing having sex, another part is saying im overreacting and she probably won't get pregnant anyway. Have u guys ever been in a similar situation? What would you do if u and ur partner aren't on the same page with this stuff? Is it a deal breaker to you personally? And also what do you suggest I do?

So ive posted on here before about how Ive always had a crush on my best friend. Me and her have been very close since early highschool days, and while we never have fooled around, i have been in very intimate situations with her when i give her full body almost nude massages. Ive been giving her these intimate massages for a long time and when i go over to her place she almost expects it, and wonders whats wrong when i don't initiate one. She has made it clear in the past that she doesnt want anything more than friendship, and as much as it hurts i accept that she doesnt want anymore. I want to continue being her friend but i think i need to distance myself from her. One of the main things that is hard to bring up is that i think i need to for my own benefit set boundaries with giving her massages. She loves it when i touch her body and compliments the way i do it. I also like doing it during the moment but i feel terrible after i do it, because i know its not going to develop into anything more. i know if i want to get over her and maybe have a normal friendship I can not continue doing that. Im not sure how 1. tell her about the distancing part 2. when we do start to hangout again, bring up the part about me not giving her body massages

Some context: I'm visiting one of my best friends for the weekend and went out with him and his girlfriend last night. At one point I wanted to take a picture of something trivial at the bar, and having recently decided to download Instagram, decided to Instagram it. My friend's girlfriend is in the shot, interacting with what I was taking a photo of. It is in no way seductive, but it's also not an unflattering photo of her. As soon as I post it, I get a series of (increasingly not passive) aggressive texts from my girlfriend about how fucking weird it is. Apparently multiple friends of hers asked her who the girl was. I can understand that she's embarrassed, and I can understand how, without context from the rest of the night, posting a photo of some random girl is weird. That being said, it's a cool photo and I don't really think I did anything wrong. Deleting the photo would be an admission of guilt and I don't think it would repair the damage that has already been done. At this point all my friends are telling me I've done nothing wrong, but I'm a little concerned they're just being supportive and telling me what I want to hear. So I'm asking you, sane reddit denizens, was it a grievous social media faux pas? Or is it just an unfortunate situation given the circumstances (namely, I don't have a portfolio of photos of her and I together on Instagram yet). Was I insensitive or is she being overly sensitive, or both?

I'll try to keep this short. We've been dating almost a year now. I am (not to brag or be condescending) more intelligent than my boyfriend is. When we first started dating I was 19 and he was 23. I fell instantly for him and I haven't looked back since. He had just finished his bachelor's degree at 24, and he is a network administrator. He's funny and smart, and he makes me laugh like no one else. The problem is that while he finished his bachelor's at 24, I am finishing my master's at 20. I am what you might call more intelligent, but I'm still not a genius by any means. He thinks that he will never be right for me and constantly puts himself down and says he is dumb. I don't think he is dumb at all. I actually think he is very intelligent. He took 6 years to get his bachelor's because he was working full time and he's now making over 60k a year in his first out of college job. He has a wealth of knowledge about music and art, and he makes me laugh. He thinks that because I have a lot of high level conversations with my student peers that it means that I want to always talk about in-depth topics. I don't. I enjoy those conversations, but I enjoy the conversations he and I have more. I guess my point is, how do I make him see that he is smart, and that he doesn't have to have a million degrees to be good enough for me? I don't give a damn about whether or not he knows how Kant is or if he can speak 4 languages. I care about him because it's *him*.

Long Story Short! Myself and my SO (24M) had a really close mutual friend, lets call him Dave. Dave was in the army and developed a very depressed mentality after losing a friend while on tour and then leaving his fiancee of 3 years. This was all around New Year of 2013 and so when he got home from tour he had 3 months holiday off base if he wanted. We encouraged him to take it and come live with us for the 3 months to recover and take time for himself. During these 3 months my SO's sister(26), lets call her Tasha, stayed with us for the holidays. She is a very unstable person when it comes to men, she is a volatile psychopath that is obsessed with control. Toni and Dave didnt really interact, they casually chatted but mostly spent time apart. Or so we thought, turns out they were sneaking around like teenagers at night and getting dirty on our couch. With Dave being in the state he was my SO kinda lost the plot and explained how Tasha was not a good idea and he was living here rent free, being fed and looked after so he can get better for free and taking advantage of his sister wasnt really a part of the agenda. Dave then said they were fooling around but he loved her and if it was okay with my SO they wanted to be a couple. My SO said he wasnt comfortable with it because he knows Tasha well, she destroys people. Dave pursues Tasha anyway and ruins our friendships by cutting us off and then also ruins my SO's relationship with his family because they all sided with Tasha. Fast forward 2 years and they're over and it was all Tashas fault (surprise surprise). I really want to reach out and repair the friendship but my SO is still in a really bad place about it and tbh, im still pretty pissed at the whole thing, but i miss our friendship and i just feel the need to know if he's okay, knowing the state he was in before the relationship begun, im genuinly concerned for his well being.

So, I'm currently a sophomore and last year my grades weren't great (two d's and a few c's). I really wasn't into school at all and I just slacked it off like an idiot. So, after that, my parents took away my phone for a week and I'm only able to use my labtop for programming or school (right in front of my mom's chair where she can watch TV and my screen at the same time). Anyways, when I started school I was so ready to do all the homework, and be organized, after I was so lazy last year. I felt so different then I did last year. Now I get home and my mother just has this weird constant anger to me over school and I do the little work that was assigned that day immediately. Afterwards she gets mad at me for not having very much work (obviously not believing that's all I had for the first day of school). She didn't care that I had been organized and did the assignment. So for the first week of school, I come home, do work, and I have no privileges afterwards. I read or some ****. My mom says this won't change until the end of this semester in which, if I have a 3.5, I will regain SOME of my privileges. It doesn't help that my sister has no privileges lost and she had worse grades. It's because she's a ""creative learner"" or some ****. That's really a stupid thing to get me mad but it really does get to me for some reason. If I bring up anything about it, she just goes off on this rant about last year (she's given the same rant quite a few times). I understand why she doesn't trust me but when I tell her I want to get A's for my self, not for her, and I feel utterly unmotivated when she babysits me. Anyways, point is, I have totally lost my motive to do good in school. Sorry for the terribly constructed question, I didn't have much time to write this during lunch.

I have been dating my girlfriend going on two years, and at a base level, it has been going great. We both share similar interests(music, rock climbing, hiking, camping), have a great sex life, and tolerate each other very well. However, for the past month or two, I have been entertaining the idea of not being with her anymore. I feel as though when we have serious talks, she is unable to really listen and often redirects the focus back to her. I haven't been feeling as physically or emotionally attracted to her as I once did and as a result of this, sex often feels forced. I have tried to talk to her about the communication barrier between us, but nothing has really changed. The major hesitation that I have with breaking up with her is that we both share the same 'friend group' who thinks that we are perfect together. It would create a lot of tension among us and I don't want to force them to choose between us as I know my girlfriend would take the breakup very hard. Now for the logistical dilemma: I am leaving on a two month trip to California in a few weeks. I wonder if the timing of this trip would make it easier to move on because of no contact or if it would just make me an asshole. I really just want both of us to be happy which is why I am struggling with this decision because I know it will hurt her very much.

First off, I have been seeing my boyfriend since April of this year. Before we started dating, we were friends for over three years. Our relationship started off as a friends with benefits situation, where he would come over a day or two a week, we would have sex, and he would leave. This quickly progressed into us hanging out a lot after work every day, then I spent a few nights over at his house, one thing led to another and now we're moving across the country together in a few weeks. During this transition (before we started recognizing our relationship as ""official"", calling each other ""my boyfriend""/""my girlfriend"" to others, etc.), he left for a week to visit some family a few states away. One night during this week, after smoking a few bowls (not that I'm using this as an excuse), I went on Omegle and flirted/chatted with a few guys, a couple of whom were over video. I ended up taking my shirt off (wearing a bra only) for a guy, who I talked with for quite a while and eventually ended up flashing him my boobs. That was all that happened before I ended the chat. No details were exchanged, nothing went further. Bear in mind that before this happened, and during this transition from FWB to SO, I had been talking to/flirting with a couple of other guys, which he knew about. But as we started getting closer, I ended these conversations altogether. So my question is, should I tell him? He's jealous, but not possessive. I would not do anything like this now that we're actually together and I don't want to make him paranoid that I might cheat, because I would never do that to anyone. I think having the conversation would do more harm than good, and it would mostly just be to make me feel better.

I need some advice for a simple problem. I'm 22 years of age, she's 21. We became Facebook official shortly after New Years. The relationship itself has been over a month. I've known her longer than that, since I met her last semester in one of my required humanities classes. We talked, clicked despite all odds, and I kissed a girl (her) for the first time on New Years. What I don't understand is why she's with me. I'm a loser, my life consists of classes, lab reports, and playing League of Legends with other STEM majors. I go to the odd party, but that's not very often. I took up lifting because the school gym is free, but believe me when I say that I'm not fit, just not fat. She's a sorority girl. Popular, ridiculously hot, blonde, etc. If she posts one thing on Facebook, you can bet she'll get 17+ likes. Has a handful of suitors that would date her if she gave them a shot. Most of these guys are copies of Ryan Gosling/Chris Pine/Ryan Reynolds. In other words, they are better than I am. It was revealed on V-day night that I was insecure as hell. She dropped the ""I love you"" bomb on me, and I didn't know how to respond. Long story short, she was NOT happy, accusing me of using her for sex. I haven't talked to her since. My best friend told me to let her call first, and I'm taking his advice because, unlike me, he's quite successful with women. And so, I spent yesterday playing LoL in an attempt to ignore this situation. I've gotten no love for 22 years, so it's new to me. The very fact that a girl, let alone an attractive one is interested in me is a foreign concept. Plus, when you have a girl that's bombarded with better options, it just makes me extremely paranoid that she'll cheat and I wind up bitter, angry, and sad. **[

First off I would like to let you all know that I have spoken to a professional about this and my therapist believes I'm ready to begin seriously dating again. I did have some issues because of this mostly trust issues and embarrassment for falling for someone like him and not seeing something was wrong. My ex [26/m] of just over a year got caught with child porn on his computer. It was a complete shock to everyone that knew him and I found out that he had lied to me about his past. He told me he was on parole for possession of weed, which to me wasn't a big deal people make mistakes and he had stopped smoking so I decided to give him a shot. He was really on parole for have sexual contact with a minor when he was 20 I believe the girl in question was 14 at the time. I never thought to google him or question his story because I trusted him. He is the best liar and manipulator I have ever met in my entire life, he had me, his friends, his coworkers, my friends and my family convinced he was a great guy. Is this something I should share with my next SO or should I just keep it to myself? If I should tell them how and when should I do it? After a couple of weeks, months in or longer?

I'm 17f, my boyfriend is 20. We've been together over a year, and were incredibly close for a couple of years before this. My boyfriend has asperger's. It isn't particularly severe and he has remained in education and is quite sociable (currently in yr 2 of uni). This is where it starts getting a bit upsetting. There are a couple of parallels between my SO(A) and my 'brother-J'. (Inverted commas as I don't see him as a brother.) J is also aspergic. He is far less sociable and less motivated. He raped me when I was 9, although he molested me before and after then, from about 7-11 years old. They are the same age. (Both currently 20). J lives with me at home which is shitty but I can handle it. A lives in London most of the time. They have met and get on well enough, my SO is always very civil. I still struggle with the whole childhood trauma thing. I didn't tell my parents until i was 13 because I was very depressed and had tried to kill myself and I didn't have a choice really. Yesterday A said something that mirrored something J had said to my mum a while ago and I tried not to let it show it upset me but it really did. A caught on really quickly. I can't really pretend around him as he knows me so well. This lead to A being very upset and we had to talk about the relationship in relation to J. I told him that it isn't his fault he reminds me of J sometimes. Are we kidding ourselves that this relationship is OK? I love my SO a lot and he has helped me come to terms with a lot of issues and we're very close. I just can't stand seeing him upset about this shit with J. It upsets me that so much of my time is dedicated to dealing with the aftermath.

Sorry for mistakes, I'm on mobile. I'm not really sure how to feel about this, I might be overreacting but I feel kind of disrespected at the moment. My boyfriend and I went to one is his friend's for New Years last night to bbq, play games and drink. I'll admit we started pretty early so everyone was very drunk. He didn't spend a lot of time with me through the night. I know some of his friends as acquaintances but that's basically it other than occasionally dropping by I was pretty much on my own. some of them have tendencies to be rude and clique-ish but I can survive hanging out on my own without him so that didn't bother me that much as what happened with his friends. Throughout the night I noticed he was being a little ""friendly"" with one of his friends girlfriends, playing on the same team, lots of hugs, playfully bumping up against her. I was sitting on a couch with some of his friends talking and they started making comments to the entire room about him in the next room over as he was acting playful with her announcing to everyone to watch as he gets turned down and laughing about it. Literally everyone watches him do this and it was like a huge joke to all of them, I felt mortified. I tried to go home after, I didn't really tell him the reason why I was annoyed at him but it basically turned into a fight. I later told him about what his friends said and he didn't agree at all that he was flirting with the girl and that it was fucked up of his friends to say that to me. Am I out of line to be upset?

So basically my girlfriend is leaving to work in America (Live in the UK) from 6th July to 16th August. Initially it was only for 4 weeks but it got extended beyond her control. We will not have contact except once a week on Saturdays and am not sure how to deal with this. I am totally in love with her, she means so much to me and being away from her for a few days without contact is painful to me. I think the biggest problem is not that she'll be gone for so long but its that she is so excited to go away as she's wanted this job for a year. I am totally happy for her and want her to enjoy her time abroad as much as possible but I couldn't help but break into tears when she told me how long she will be away. She seems so happy and is barely even seeming sad or upset that we wont be able to see each other & although she keeps saying it, I just don't believe that she'll miss me that much. I know this sounds selfish, but I love her and being away from her for that long with such limited contact (usually talk everyday) will break my heart. Any advice on how to deal with this and accept it / get over the time we'll spend apart? Please console me in some respect, I really have no idea how to deal with this.

I feel shitty even bringing this up, but wanted to know if anyone thought this was even remotely attainable. So I recently started using tinder because I just graduated college and I don't meet many girls on a daily basis being busy with work. I hit it off with a girl on the tinder messaging I didn't find very attractive but we had similar interests. We began texting and added each other on fb. I haven't been trying very hard but I do really like her personality so I'm attempting to give her a try, especially since she seems really interested. She apparently is really close with her sister and they had a good amount of fb photos together, and god I find her sister gorgeous. Looking through her public fb stuff she seems to have a very similar personality as my date, just so much more my type. Honestly feel like she has potential to be my perfect girl, and I'd like to confirm my suspicions before its too late. Anyone have any helpful past experiences or advice on what I should do? I feel bad leading this girl on, but I am trying to give her a chance since we match so well in personality. It would just be incredible if I could meet and hit it off with her sister though. Feel like this is an episode of Seinfeld. In fact I'm pretty sure this happened in some way but it was Jerry trying to go out with his date's roommate.

When we first started dating, we fell in love very fast; he would go out of his way to see me. Everything seems to be going great, although I've been getting more and more upset because I don't get to see him as much as I did when we first started dating. It seems that he would rather spend time with his buddies. Reddit, am I having crazy thoughts. Do you think that he doesn't want to spend as much time with me, because he is loosing interest in me, or is it just a matter of busy schedules. Should I even ask him about it?

We exchanged a couple messages wish misc. contents, in her last one she asked if I'd hang out with her, ""maybe with Tim or somthing (name changed)"". I told her that I'd like to and gave her my number. She said something like ""Perfect, I'll hit you up!"", she is out of town right now and I assume she meant she will come back at me when she's back. This has been a week ago now and I haven't heard from her yet. I know Tim, he went out with her once but he assured me she didn't really like him. What does that girl's behavior mean? How am I supposed to act? Wait until she contacts me again? I have never seen a girl acting that ""agressive"" towards me, but I like her and would like to meet her. On the other hand I don't want to appear ""needy"". Thank you!

Hey there fellow redditors and people geniuses. So I'm in a bit of a bind and need confirmation basically on what I already know. Bit of background, I met a girl after trying to help a stray dog, we ended up sharing numbers for information on the dogs whereabouts when it eventually fled from us. After time and conversation we gave up hope and just started chatting aimlessly till I got the courage to ask her out, she agreed to my surprise and seemed pretty interested in our date, so I thought anyway. Few days before the date whilst we were conversing she apologised as she couldn't make it to our date as she forgot she had a party to go to with her mother then, I didn't think much of it things happen, we reschedule for the day after. As we get to the day of I send her a text to make sure she can make it so I don't turn up like an idiot. She apologised again said she woke up sick and had a busy work day so she wasn't up to it, at this point I thought hell with it, she can set up the next one then. She said recheduling would be great but she never set a time so I just stayed conversing with her for a few days after before she eventually said that she was too busy with assignments and would like to wait till those were done. At this point I lost interest and thought what ever at least she will be a good friend, fun personality and good with conversation so no harm. Till we hit the current situation, she lost battery at our last conversation and didn't text me till I messaged her a day or so later. She gave another excuse, her phone charger broke and she didn't get a new one till that day I texted again, I sent a joke text mocking her for leaving me hanging. No response. Basically, I get she's ghosting me and probably not interested anymore but I lost interest in her that way as well and wanted to stay cool as friends, a part of me wants to call her out on ghosting and to say we should just be chill and friends, another realises that's probably too much and should just let it all slip away.

Over the last couple of months my friend had stopped responding to me. I tried to contact, but never got a response so I stopped trying. There was no argument and I thought we were on good terms, so I had no idea what the problem was. Recently, he texted apologizing for not responding and asked if we could meet up and talk, which I agreed to. He basically told me that his girlfriend was jealous of me and that he was concerned that I liked him too much and that put a strain on their relationship. So he thought the easiest way to fix this was to cut me out of his life. After a months, he felt bad and contacted me. I like my friend a lot, but as only a friend, not at all romantically. He kind of laughed it off and said once he ran this by his now fiance, everything should be good and we can be friends again. The problem is that I don't really want to. I feel betrayed and disrespected by him. I like to have a few very close friends and he had been one of them. I just feel like I mean nothing to him and just want to move on with my life. Am I being overly dramatic? Should I forgive him? I told him I'd think about it and he said that it was fine. I don't know what to do. Part of me never wants to see him again, but I also want to go back being friends with him.

My ex is also my best friend, she is doing her own thing and has a lot of friends but I don't and only really have her. She is an amazing person and really my only friend. Because i have been relying on her so much, and her on me, it put a strain on our friendship. That coupled with hooking up frequently led me to develop feelings for her I know she doesn't have for me. She knows I have feelings for her and it hurt her because she felt whenever she hooked up with someone that she was a whore and a bitch as it would hurt me. We talked about it and agreed to take a break from talking for a while as me having feelings for her and relying on her emotionally hurt her and constricted her. Which is not what I want to do. The problem is I now think when she said we should stop talking ""for a while"" she meant forever and I can't stop freaking out. And now I don't know if she ever wants to be friends again or even misses me. She has troubles of her own and I feel I was unfair to rely on her as much as I did. Before her I had huge social anxiety and did not have a friend for over 2 years, just working out and studying all day. And I am worried that it is starting to happen again.

We started dating over the summer. She was an old high school friend, and we starting catching up and it turned into something more. I've met most of her family, she's met a lot of mine, and for a while everything was going really well. Some background, though: she's had longstanding anxiety issues, PTSD issues due to an emotionally and verbally abusive father, and used to have OCD which was weeded out by her father (and caused the PTSD). She only recently opened up to me completely about all of these issues and I'm one of only two non-relatives who are aware of the issues. We've been in a long distance relationship for a month now and she's planning on visiting me this week. I'm really not sure if I'm emotionally equipped to handle a long distance relationship while trying to help her through these issues. She was prescribed high doses of anti-anxiety medication and ADD medication to help her cope with the anxiety, but she's never actually been to someone to help her get through the issues rather than just treat the symptoms. She also refuses to tell her mother because ""her mom has a lot on her plate already,"" despite the fact that she has as close a relationship with her mom as I've ever seen in any parent/daughter pair. She's had trust issues with men for a long time, and is only starting to get over them with me. I feel like by breaking up with her, I'll be violating her trust and it'll just send her in a downward spiral, and I really don't want to be responsible for something like that happening to someone. I really care about her, but I really don't know that I can keep this going.

My wife and I have been married for 6 years, we're both 28. I always knew she was the jealous type, but lately it feels worse than it's ever been. I've been building a (strictly friend-only) relationship with a couple women that I've met, and the way she talks about it, I feel like she's accusing me of cheating on her, which is something I'd never do. To me, there's nothing weird about male-female friendship at all. I don't think I should feel guilty about going out to lunch with a friend or talking on the phone, or texting or anything, but it seems to drive my wife crazy. We have a 2 year old together, and I love my kid, but lately it just feels like I'm growing away from my wife. I love her, she's my high school sweetheart and she's the mother of my child, but I can't handle this jealousy. Basically, my wife is pressuring me into never having any kind of a close friendship with anyone of the opposite sex, and I feel like that's completely unreasonable for her to ask of me. There's more history between my wife and I, but this is what bothers me the most lately. Help!

We have been working in the same office since last year. I always liked him, we were good friends, he helped me a lot. This february he divorced his wife and moved out. A couple of weeks later we had our first kiss, and since then we have been together. I am totally in love with him and he loves me very much too. He wants me to move in with him. I would really want it but I am not 100% sure. I am so deeply in love, I can't think about the future now, but I need some reassurance, and advice from people who had similar relationships. My worries: The age gap is big, maybe some day I will want a kid too, but he doesn't. We work together in the same office, in the same team, we are together 24/7, which I like very much, but I don't want it to get boring, we talk about work a lot at home too.

My[30m] wife[28f] and I have been trying to conceive for about a year and a half now, but no lck. We've started seeing fertility doctors, and they've checked us out, everything is fine with her, but I have low sperm motility, meaning I have ample sperm, but they aren't getting to the egg. I had been a daily pot smoker and the doctor said this was the most likely reason for the problem. My wife was upset as she had asked me to stop smoking months before (she doesn't have a problem with smoking per se as she smokes sometimes too), and I hadn't. I didn't take it seriously at first as I have many friends who smoke far more than I do and have kids. Anyways, after the doctor said to stop, I stopped, that was two months ago. Two weeks ago at a party I slipped up and had some puffs n a joint. I feel incredibly guilty about it and am torn as to whether I should own up to it or not. I really don't want to keep things from my wife, but she will be incredibly disappointed in me if she finds out. Advice?

I'm an asshole. I met her just a few months ago I fell for her right away. I was in a relationship at the time, but I ended it. We hooked up a few times, but I was never sure what she really thought of me. Once, she asked me what I was thinking about. I answered that I thought that we might shouldn't see each other anymore. That I wanted to be alone for a while. Actually, that was not what I was thinking about at all. I think that I was thinking about if I could write a formula to solve a rubiks cube. She cried the whole day and I enjoyed her uncomfortness, how she hanged on to me, pounded her fists against my chest and told me to never say that again. She didn't really recover. She didn't want to see me anymore. She told me that she didn't long for our future together. How do you know if it's really over? I think that it's when you are more in love with your past than in your future. We didn't see each other after that, except for in class. But I really love her. I hate that I love her and I love her so much that I hate myself. And now I'm single, alone and can't deal with it. I need her more than I love her and I love her so fucking much.

Before I begin, just want to point out this is my first post, so things will probably be incorrect or to long also this is my first girlfriend. So about a week ago, my girlfriend (now ex) came down to visit me. We had a distance between us I lived in Hamilton, she lived in Toronto. So she comes down to visit me last Saturday, I pick her up from the train station and then we went back to my house. Since it was around noon I thought we could go for some lunch and she agreed. Everything seemed fine we went out had a nice lunch and caught up about what we've recently been doing. Then we go back to my house to watch some Netflix and cuddle like we normally do. At first she wasn't cuddling, I thought she was just cold because shes done it before. We watched an episode, then the next one starts and then she said ""Can we talk?"" my heart sank immediately, I had this horrible gut feeling that she wanted to end our relationship. She did. Her reasoning was because, the distance, school and it felt like she wasn't dating me. (Shes in Pharmacy school so it is a lot of work). Sure I felt the same that we have lost a bit of the fire but that happens in a distance relationship. Something just doesn't feel right about it to me. I mean we've been dating for 8 months of distance and we were fine her first semester. But I don't know, any thoughts/advice?

She tells me that he says I'm beautiful, gorgeous etc. In response to all of the snaps she sent. A little while after we finish messing around, Jonathan starts texting me. Samantha is teasing me about how he likes me and is in love me and stuff. Jonathan ends up texting me ""would you ever consider going out with me?"" and me, not wanting to be mean or rude says, ""yeah, if we could formally meet"" so he asks me out to the movies with him and I tell him idk, if I can then sure.

Only my friends accept that I'm not gay, and that's because they hear details about my personal life and the girls I hook up with. My family, on the other hand, thinks I am gay. Their reasoning is something like this. /u/simKard never talks about girls he's dating and has never had a steady girlfriend, so he must like guys and be afraid to tell us. They think that I'm ""in the closet,"" but that's absolutely not true. I'm just not like them. I like sex, but I don't feel a desire to be in a relationship. I don't think they can understand that not everyone broadcasts their personal life and I prefer to keep those things to myself. I do date girls, but I don't have serious relationships with the ones I see. It's just sex without a serious commitment, which is why I don't ever mention these relationships to my family. What's the point when I know these girls aren't going to be in my life very long? I'm just tired of my parents, grandparents, and siblings thinking I am something that I'm not, and I'm also tired of having my sister and mom try to set me up on dates with men. I've never given them a legitimate reason to think I'm gay, so it baffles me that they continue to believe I am. I don't know if the solution to this is to be more open with them about my interest in women and other details from my personal life or something else. The only problem is they may still think I'm lying to protect my secret. I really don't know why it's so hard for them to accept that I'm being honest with them about being straight.

My girlfriend and I were living together in a college town 45 mins from where we currently live. We lived downtown and were surrounded by other young people. We recently moved into my childhood home with the intention of buying after 6 month, if we liked it, else it will go on the market to someone else. Ever since we moved in she has complained how she hates it here and is unhappy here. She also complains that my parents are always over here, though this is rarely the case and only to do landlord things (e.g. fixing electrical issues, relighting the pilot light, etc.) Though other days she'll say how the house is growing on her. She is depressed (clinically?) and has said that she isn't sure if moving back would really make her happy about everything.

My girlfriend and I met in late September through a mutual friend and sparks flew instantly. She lived five hours away at the time and we still managed to find time to see one another. After a month of that she moved and is 45 minutes away, but is now living with her father. I moved to the area from across the country in February and we are scheduling a move out west in March of next year. Her dad is a controlling sort, and that's fine, but for some reason just does not like me **at all** He and I have only met three times, the first two were very brief, and the third my girlfriend and I had been drinking and the conversation seemed to go well. We were not affectionate (my girl and I...not her dad and I....smart asses) and he is to this day not aware we are ""dating"" Shortly after she had told him she was going to go hang out with me one time he began to express that he did not like me. Referencing my accent to a bad ex she had before, saying he did not like my anarchist views, and saying she ""shouldn't be dating anyone right now."" This I could somewhat understand as she did just jump from her ex to myself. Just two days ago I came and slept at her dads house, him not knowing I was there like we had done many times before. He apparently heard me and was furious, though we did not know until later the next day. He didn't confront me about it, but rather her, and as a result, she had a conversation tonight with him where he said ""I like *all* all your other friends"" Reddit, *HELP* I want him to like me so much. This gal and I are great for each other! I want to see if he is man enough to sit down with me and discuss this situation, I need some pointers and advice on how to do this, and even how to organize it, she can hardly talk to the man.

Idk. I tried adding her on facebook twice. The first time being back in December and that response was left for a week or so before I took it off, then the next time in February for like 5 minutes before I took it off. She's not shy, either. Am I overthinking this? She has over 500 friends and she doesn't post alot. I'm in highschool. I'm a senior and she's a junior (18, 17). She doesn't know me one bit, aside from the fact that we have some mutual friends, and that she knows i'm in band and guitar, and that she is in choir (i've seen her perform). So I said that I've seen her around alot, and then later on I asked if she'd like to do something sometime. This was during a passing period, I kinda chickened out the first time I tried and she might've noticed, but this time I did it. She said she has a boyfriend I said ahh bummer alright. That was basically it. I haven't talked with her for about 2 months, and I feel like I should since I don't think she has a boyfriend anymore and that I still think about her everyday. I've seen her walking while hanging with my friends, and the guy she was talking to got called over by my friends and she looked at me and walked on. I'm a bit worried to find she thinks i'm a stalker/desperate/creep/creepass/weirdo/asshole/player. But at the same time it's killing me to find out because I have 3 months (or 2 months?) left of school. Maybe I should just wait and she'll come to me?

She seems to have trouble holding a job down, and instead of wanting to work an entry-level job, she would rather do things like use webcam sites and sell pictures, and videos of herself. I allowed her to try it out first but it emotionally destroyed her because some people on that site were really nasty to her. I've expressed that I am not comfortable with her doing things like that and she has agreed not to do them. But she still resents me for it. So she sees what she can and can't do. The latest thing... Selling her used panties because people pay a lot of money for them supposedly. I told her I would prefer it if she just worked a job that didn't involve any sort of erotic nature. I told her I'm fine with her being a model if she wanted to because although she's showing off her body and I'm sure there will be people that get off on that, she's not doing it with that intent... Or at least I hope not. But apparently to her, there is no difference to her and I won't let her do anything she wants. To me, I've drawn a line with what I'm okay and not okay with. My concern is that although it is anonymous by nature, there is still a chance of it getting leaked somehow and potentially affecting her chances of getting a job, or even in extreme cases some sort of stalking occurs. Plus, the idea of her giving something personal to someone else for the purpose of getting him off disgusts me.

She met sister that she didn't see for years, I'm 99% sure that she told me that she didn't see hers aunt for years, whereas she told me that she saw her few months ago (I'm not sure about this though). But history from today i just.. Winning a lottery is nothing. She said she saw her mother, which sat next to her. She is in foster family and saw her BIOLOGICAL one, first time in 7 years. Her mother started to talk about HER history, thinking that she isn't her daughter. To start with, this is pretty unbelievable, but hey, this history is just starting off. After finishing the story she said to her ""Hey, that's probably me."" She, apparently shocked, ran away from the bus. She went to a job interview, went back with the same bus, and the same woman entered the same bus. After she left the bus, she started following her, to find out that she's hanging out with some bad guys, etc, sad story here, tears etc. So, she was sending me text messages all the way through, but I'm still doubting this, and some other stories. The thing why I doubt it happened is, that day before she said she wanted to do something to her best friend - I asked her coz I wanted to do the same but as a suprise for her - turned out she didn't know about such conversation at all with her. I'm really worried if she doesn't have some mental issues where she creates fake stories and really believes them. It's only a top of an iceberg - I wanted to take her out from foster house just because she tells me they are inhuman to her, but now, I'm not really sure if that's true aswell.

I've been with my boyfriend for over 2 years now, he is 19 and I am 18f. He looks after me really well in a lot of ways, he often drives me to work etc and this makes me feel like the relationship is a little unbalanced, like I can't screw up or ask for too much because I constantly feel like I owe him you know? Anyway I've never had a huge sex drive but would still have sex a reasonable amount, until recently when my self esteem has been pretty bad (as well as anxiety) after I was assaulted a few months ago. Now I usually want to just go to sleep or am nervous during sex. He however wants to have sex a lot which is probably expected for a guy his age, but sometimes if we kiss or cuddle in bed he expects it to lead to sex and gets annoyed when it doesn't (I understand it's frustrating - but I just don't want to have sex man haha). Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with him touching me or trying to take off my underwear (I think he does it half asleep?) and he always wants to put it in without a condom even when I make it clear I'm not comfortable with doing that. I don't know whether this is common behaviour or not, it's just very annoying because I already feel bad enough about not wanting sex and his pushy behaviour makes me want it even less.

I am interested in this girl, which happens to be my friends ex. I am closer to her than to him though. When me and her first met, it was sometime during spring or summer of last year. Me and her instantly connected as friends though. She understands me, unlike everybody else where I live. I have helped her and my friend with relationship problems before. Of course, I would rather her be happy with him than me happy with her. From my point of view, their relationship wasn't the best. All he is interested in doing is smoking weed and she has told me that she feels he always needs to be high and is always high when they hang out. Not too long ago, she ended up cheating on him. Her and I were talking about that, and she owned up to her mistake, and I'm not judging her on it, because we all make mistakes, and I could tell it was killing her inside, and she also lost a lot of friends because of it. Her and her ex are trying to work stuff out, and they are kind of waiting a little before they start dating again to make sure it's what they both want. I'm waiting for a confirmation on whether or not they will be getting back together before I make any moves. I have told her that I have my eye on someone (her), but she doesn't know it's her. I keep telling myself that I can't help who I'm attracted to. Is this a wrong thing to do? How should I go about telling her without totally ruining the friendship between me and her? Oh, and please, no judgment over the fact that she cheated. If anything happens between me and her, I will be cautious, but I doubt she will do it again.

My girlfriend and I have been together nearly two years, back in February we moved out together and in June we got our own place together. We got kitten who is now a full grown cat. Now before we even moved in together I told her I did not want her dog in the apartment. He's a chihuahua and has always been an outside dog. I don't like chihuahuas at all. She knows this and has known this sense we met. A little over a month ago I got us another kitten so now we had two. With this I agreed to give her dog a try. Two days ago she bought the paperwork she needed to bring the dog into our apartment as the landlord doesn't allow dogs but can't deny him with this paperwork. She brought him here the next day. This dog only is ever quite if she's home. If she's not he yaps for hours. That and he attacks our cats and she's seen it but does nothing but defend him. He refuses to use the bathroom outside because ""your watching him."" If he continues to piss in the house we'll lose to deposit due to damage. (Not that they'll likely give it to us now anyway knowing there is a dog here.) I'm trying to give this dog a chance despite how much I dislike him.

Life has been hard for the both of us, I have medical problems and she was robbed at gunpoint by a friend (now ex-friend who has 42 months in prison). Due to the robbery she became really depressed and I was unable to console her because of the long distance and I failed to see how serious the situation was to her. She went to this friend for condolence and ended up putting us on a break. She dated this guy, and when I found out I broke up with her. After a week she tells me how much more important I am to her than he is, and how she wants to marry and have children with me and just needed someone to be there for her when I wasn't. I wasn't keen on any of this but I love my girlfriend to death. I don't experience the same kind of happiness or pure joy with anyone I've ever met. She has never cheated on me and has only lied to me once that I know about. I wanted to talk to her one night but she said she was going to sleep because she had to be up early, instead she was at her friend's house (a gay friend who I enjoy her hanging out with because I have never had to worry) and not sleeping. She told me she lied because I was being too controlling, which I probably was. I feel like I'm in denial about her, and my love for her. Is this something that I should be okay with? How do I ask her about it (remember, we're long distance)? Is this a warning sign? The tattoo appears to be nearly 200 or 300.

Molly and I are really close friends, though our friendship is long distance for now. Lately I've been feeling pretty.. Unimportant to her. She has a second group if friends who she always plays therapist to. So, more often than not my evenings with her are cut short because someone else needs her advice on how not to kill themselves. I've told her about my feelings before and she had kinda expected that I feel this way, but she didn't make any changes. Basically she told me, she feels bad but I'm more stable than they are. So she continues doing what she's been doing. I mean.. I don't know the other friends that much, but they're extremely dramatic, and prone to.. ""emotional breakdowns"". Like.. I love her and I'm super happy for the time we do get to talk... But I wish there was some certainty. Every time we talk there's about 50% chance someone else will need her, but I should worry, she'll be right back. Then four hours pass, and then five, and I never hear from her for the rest of the night. Am I wrong in feeling a little jiped? She's important to me and I always get the short straw. Like, right now. This is my last day, for a week, of reliable cell/Internet service and she's spending it on Skype with someone who is asleep and not even conscious of her company.

Throwaway because he's a redditor, you know the deal. I just want to start by saying that I know that this shouldn't bother me. It's pretty much standard for men to watch porn and whatnot, but I can't help but feel sick to my stomach thinking that the man I love gets off to other women masturbating. Of course these women are absolutely gorgeous and I can't compare. I can't even reassure myself that it's all fake because they are from subs that are very authentic and ""girl next door"" beautiful. I've tried to make myself get over it, to just push it down and not think about it but we browse reddit together and sometimes I notice he's watching a video of a girl playing with herself and I feel absolutely awful. He knows I don't like it so he doesn't do it around me that often but I know he still does. And that's okay. I just feel terrible when I think about him watching a beautiful woman orgasm and wonder if he'd rather be fucking her. I'm sure this sounds ridiculous but it's really bothering me. I don't know if I should even bring it up again because we've talked about it before and he says they mean nothing to him, and it isn't affecting our sex life. I want to stop worrying about this and be the cool, secure girlfriend that doesn't mind what their SO does or who they might want to fuck. Is there something wrong with me? What can I do?

She broke it off just under 2 weeks ago because we (or more specifically I) were/was acting like friends more than a couple. She was my first girlfriend and to be honest I didnt know what I could have done. Anyway i was on her twitter profile one night being generally upset (know it doesnt help but I couldnt help myself) and found a tumblr blog. Its hers and she mainly reposts or reblogs pictures or gifs of couples deeply kissing and fooling around, you might know the type of thing. i'm guessing thats what she is looking for in a relationship, something i thought she said she didnt fairly early on when she said she wanted to take things slowly and not rush. We were going out for around 3 months by the way. I know thats the kind of relationship I want with her and Im wondering if a second chance is possible?. i want to let her know and ask her but dont know if its going to come across creepy, am i too late or am i just being an idiot.

This isn't a huge problem, relatively, but it's certainly annoying and causes stress in mine and my fiancé's relationship, as well as our relationship with his mother. We live in Washington, DC but my fiancé's parents live in South Carolina. We usually see his parents around twice a year -- once in the summer when they drive up to visit us and once in the winter right after Christmas when either my fiancé or both of us fly down. Right now we haven't seen them since June and fiancé's mother is starting to act super weird. She did this before we saw her last, too, so I'm assuming it's when she doesn't see us for a while. She starts stalking our Facebooks and Twitters (mostly mine, really, just because I post more I guess) and commenting on almost every single thing. She tagged us today in a status that said ""Eating Taco Bell. Wish [me] and [my fiancé] were here. They love Taco Bell."" This is just starting, and from our experience with how she was before we saw them in June, it's going to get a lot worse. We love her but we don't know what to do and we don't know when we're going to get to visit them again so there's a chance it could be a couple more months of this (not sure why they don't come see us... it's cheaper...). Fiance already calls her every other day so it's not that she never hears from us. I know she misses her son, and I know it's because he is an only child and she is very attached to him, but holy crap. She basically stalks us, making us very uncomfortable and stressed out. What can we do to make her handle the distance better?

So my girlfriend told me that she doesn't find herself attractive. I chalked it up to girlish lack of self-confidence and being self-aware and stuff. A lot of girls have that. But she also said that she likes it when other guys find her attractive. I got a little bit upset because it sounds like she is searching for validation from other guys and me, not just me. Was I wrong to get upset? I can understand if I am just being immature dumb, but I am worried that I'm actually dealing with a bigger problem. We have been happily dating for almost 5 months.

My husband has a stressful job. He works long hours and has a lot of responsibilities riding on his shoulders. Some of it is by choice-he wants to work extra hard to be promoted- and some of it is just the nature of the job. I don't think I am a demanding wife. I am happy with most things, I don't nag, I make sure I do the things he likes and shy away from the things he doesn't. The problem is that sex is really important to me; I have a very high sex drive and think about/want sex a lot. I struggle a lot with this part of myself. I don't know why I have such a high sex drive- I did not choose to have it and I don't know how to kill it. Because of the stress of his job, my husband is rarely in the mood for sex no matter how hard I try to turn him on or change his mind. I don't think I am unattractive as I am always told that I am very pretty. We have sex once a week on average which is not that bad but even for this one time that we do, I have to ""wait"" for him to be in the mood. He says that this is how he has always been and doesn't get influenced by external stimuli as it has to come from within him. I feel like I failed at being a woman sometimes. I don't have any ""power""(for a lack of a better word) over him and he has all the power. This is really affecting me psychologically and makes me feel like shit. We talked extensively about this. He says that I am just adding an extra layer of stress to his life if I ask for sex. I obviously don't want to cause him any more stress. I want him to want to have sex and not feel obligated to. But at the same time, I am not having my needs met. My question is: How do I balance being understanding and having my needs met? Where does it become selfish of me to ask for sex?

Married 21 years, together 23. Friends since pre-teen. She has always been depressed. I have had my bouts too. We have two kids, girl 18, boy 16. I learned to deal with my depression 15 years ago. She hasn't. She refuses to do anything to help herself. She won't get out of bed. She has stopped scratching, which is a small win. She takes medication, which is fine, but refuses to change her behaviours. Our daughter is mirroring her behaviour. She cuts unless medicated. She will not get out of bed unless forced. Our son is introverted with non-family people, but extroverted with family. He has gone from top of class to failing in 6 months. None will accept help other than acquiescing to the force of my will. I am tired. I can't do this any more. I have swung from controlled depression to paralysing anxiety and back over the last two years. I am left with anger as daily motivation. I essentially have to yell people out of bed, to school, to eat, to bathe. I am the sole income, working up to 80 hours per week. I have to be the motivation for four people to function. If I take my eye off them for a moment, relax about a symptomatic behaviour, they get worse. Yesterday I got violent. Nobody got hurt. My son got pinned against a wall, ironically for threatening violence against his mother. I made it abundantly clear I was physically capable of more. I have to leave before it gets worse.

Ill try to keep it short. We started dating in the tail-end of highschool and she was the coolest person ever loved life loved to make silly jokes and i felt comfortable enough to tell her anything i needed to. We loved eachother not to mention our sex life for the first year was great, i felt loved and desired. She was always in theatre its her passion. I support her even though i have no knowledge of any of it but i loved that she did somthing different that i could watch and enjoy. Theatre has many gay men and various types of people (full spectrum lets say) which is fine i like to meet new people and be exposed. Side note- Im in no way discriminatory grew up with lesbian neighbors in a non religous household had friends of different races etc (not that i should have evidence just saying) But goddamn I dont know if it was college or her friends but she turned into an over-sensitive constantly bitching needy person. I dont like the term but the closest thing i can find is an SJW. Every subject has to comeback to some equality bullshit, she turns everything into a huge debate and nit picks at almost everything. All she does is watch drag queen shows and gay cross dressing youtubers. Normally i wouldnt give a fuck but this has affected my self esteem, our sex life, and the entire relationship. Sex has become basically non existent. I feel like a pig if i get aroused laying in bed with her. I dont feel loved or desired, she spends more time looking at gay men sing and dance then the straight one sitting right next to her. it makes me feel like shit. She spends hours daily rehearsnig for her plays surrounded by men both gay and straight. I cant help but be jealous by the amount of love and affection she shows to her gay friends. I dont know what happened but in some bizzaro world i cant help to think if i was gay my girlfriend would love me more. Perplexing We had a big agrument yesterday and i havent communicated since. Really did some reflecting on the whole thing and im ready to call it quits.

So there's this girl from my college that I'm kinda into and we're both at home with our families in NYC since we're on break. On new years, we kissed a couple times and she even told our mutual friend about it. We talked about hanging out, smoking some weed on my roof, but I honestly don't know where to take it from there. Whenever we talk, we always have interesting conversations, but I don't know what to do with her if I invite her over. Like we can chill and smoke on my roof but I don't know where to take it from there. In the past, I've typically asked girls to like come chill in my room and listen to music and then maybe something happens. I'm very awkward when it comes to this stuff, but I try to display (faked) confidence. I've had girlfriends before, not in a while, but I'm just confused/nervous as to keep her from getting bored.

Background: I've known this girl since middle/high school. We weren't great friends or anything over those years, but we were friends. Last December we sort of hooked up, but I was living out of state at the time. I moved back home about a month ago (not because of her) but since I was back I thought we could start something. She is in med school so she is busy as crap, which I get, so I've been trying to play it cool, especially because I really like her a lot. I don't want to give away too many emotions too quick, plus I'm not a touchy feely type of person anyway. Fastforward to St Pattys day and we were drinking and I told her I wanted to ask her out, she said to do it sober and I did. Well that date never happened until last weekend, neither of us were hungry so we just went for ice cream. We get along really well, she laughs at all my jokes, but I have no clue if shes just being a friend or she actually likes me. Here is where I get really confused: When we text sometimes it is like I don't hear from her for hours, which is fine because she is busy. Sometimes it doesn't bother me but I can't tell if thats a sign of her being busy or not interested. For example, when we were originally suppose to go on our date she got sick, then she said lets go during the week (I never texted her that week, because she moved the date) so I never heard from her until that weekend we did go out. I thought she didn't like me then she hits me with that. She is also known for being super friendly so that doesn't help my confusion.

I have more issues than a phone book, and it's my own fault. Now that I recognize that it's my own problem, I want to try to fix it before I ruin my relationship and/or drive myself crazy. I've been dating my boyfriend for 5 months now; he's 27 and I'm 24. Things are great, for the most part. We have some issues communicating, but we are both shy people and we are working on that. We trust each other and enjoy each other's company. Because things are so great, I don't want to upset the balance by mentioning my insecurities. So that brings me here. I'll admit that I'm extremely self conscious and insecure, but I do my best to avoid dragging my boyfriend into that. They're my problems and I'm working on them. This, however, I cannot seem to rationalize. My best friend knew my boyfriend years ago before I even met him (weird turn of events). When she knew him, he was in love with his best friend's sister, who did not reciprocate. They were good friends and went to an event together, where she slept with him, but did not want to date him. They're still friends and he doesn't know I know this. I feel like she's the one who got away to him, and now I found out that he's messaged her on Facebook about us visiting her when we fly out to her state to visit some of his family. I know that what happened is in the past and he's with me now, but there's no way I can go hang out with this girl my boyfriend had feelings for. No way. The problem - he doesn't know that I know they slept together, or that he had feelings for her, etc. He talks about her a lot any way, and it's always bothered me but I never mentioned it because he talks about other friends, too. I guess I just want to know: are these feelings of jealously normal? Am I being unreasonable for not wanting to meet her/visit her? Or hear about her, for that matter? We haven't really discussed our sexual past yet, but I feel like this is something he should mention.

Here's my original post for some context on my emotional state earlier this week: Quick brief on that situation: BPD ex, I was made into a villain, we haven't spoken in 20 days and probably never will again. Very painful breakup and my first long-term relationship. I've been coping in all the ways you would recommend. I've been working out, spending lots of time in social situations and with friends, practicing positivity, going full NC (not even checking online), doing things I love and re-learning how to enjoy being alone. An unexpected result of my self-dating was that I met someone new through a mutual friend. We talked for a little bit and I asked her out to coffee and we're going later today. It's kind of funny, because I forgot how insane my first date anxiety is because I've been in a relationship for 7 months and it's been 8 months since I got out there and played the game. Maybe it's good that I'm replacing my anxiety about my ex with anxiety about the new person, but I'd prefer to just be comfortable. I've had my moments where I feel totally good and ready for this, but I'm quite a bit nervous right now. How did you establish comfort dating after a breakup? This girl seems cool and I'd love to make a solid first impression without being awkward. I'm a reasonably good-looking guy, and I have plenty of confidence, but I come off as awkward (which is usually interpreted as me being ""real""), mostly because I want to be my date's friend and feel uncomfortable making advances or outright flirting. Any last-minute advice would be clutch.

My GF and I moved in 2 months ago. She does all of the grocery shopping and cooking; I'm a horrible cook, so I don't mind. However, she never seems to make enough food for me! She tends to give me about the same portion that she eats, which isn't a good idea since she is a petite girl and I'm 6'5. I always thought she just didn't realize how much food I need, but no matter how often I told her she didn't seem to get it. I buy a lot of snacks and eat out so that I'm not hungry all the time. That probably makes me sound fat, but I'm too skinny if anything. I weigh about 160 pounds. And 3 years ago, when I first met my GF, I was seriously underweight. I was too broke to afford decent food and worked a physically strenuous job, which, at the worst point, resulted in me weighing 120lbs. I looked horrifying and I had no idea why she was attracted to me at the time. Anyway, when my circumstances changed I got back to a normal weight pretty quickly. I noticed that my gf seemed less interested in sex but I thought it was the honeymoon period wearing off. Yesterday my gf left her laptop open on the bed while she was gone. It was open to her porn folder lol. I was curious so I scrolled through it and I was freaked out by what I found. It was all pics of extremely skinny guys. Skinnier than me... some of them looked legitimately anorexic and many looked like young teenagers. Suddenly it all made sense... why she was attracted to me when I looked like a skeleton... and why she refuses to make enough food for me. I'm still fucking creeped out. I haven't brought it up to her because I don't know what to say. Is it possible that I'm overreacting and this stuff is just a fantasy? Is it normal for your SO to have trouble figuring out the right portions for you? Idk man. I love my gf but this shit is starting to get creepy.

We both go to the same college and live in the same dorm building. The same hallway to be exact. Lately I've been feeling ""out"" of the the relationship. I feel single but still in a committed relationship if that makes sense. We almost broke up last winter but decided not to, and for the most part everything has been fantastic since then, expect the past couple weeks. I've been noticing others girls, getting closer to some friends, and just feeling like I might have outgrown my relationship. I know that if/when I break up with her it's totally going to blindside her and that hurts, because I still love and care for her. I just don't see a future in this relationship anymore. So, I guess I have a couple questions. Do you think I should wait these feelings out and see if they go away, or should I pul the band aid off? If I do break up, how will that work? She lives down the hall from me so I know we would still see each other a lot. Her sibling also attends our school so it would be impossible to avoid them. How would the schematics of this break up work? I'm sorry, I just always worry about the technicalities in situations like this.

So I just got out of an emotionally abusive relationship and I'm scared. I'm scared because my whole life I've been told to trust my gut and be confident in my ability to read people. Before this I really did consider myself a good judge of character and thought I surrounded myself with good guys. I know after reading some of the horror stories on here that I'm definitely on the lesser end of the spectrum and I truly feel for everyone who has to go through this because I know how shitty it feels to be the victim. God, I hate that word: victim. You hear about these things happening and you think ""that's not me. I would stand up for myself"" but it's so hard to believe when it actually happens. You always think of an excuse. Why it's your fault. How you can look past your respective issues because your love is real and he's only so animated because he cares about you. Don't you care about him? This went on for a year and a half before I finally broke it off and I'm absolutely terrified to start over with someone else. What if I attract these people? What if I fall into a pattern of abusive relationships? The issue is the subtlety I think. I heard this little analogy the other day actually: if you put a frog into boiling water it'll jump out but if you put a frog into warm water and slowly turn up the heat until the water is boiling, the frog will stay in the water until it dies. So much of the time, the problem is nothing incredibly extreme. It's just subtle enough to pass off as something other than abuse. It flies under the radar until you feel shitty ALL THE TIME and are constantly wondering what went wrong. Sorry about the rant I just really need an outlet and I'm wondering if any of you guys feel the same way. If so, how do you deal with it? Thanks so much to anyone who takes the time to respond. It means more than you know.

We've known each other for over a year, we're talking to each other on IM Messenger every single day. I consider his best friend w/ benefit because we both don't care about relationship. Though, the problem is there is a girl who is obsessive in him, but he's being cold-hearted against her, and it was a year, she is in relationship with him (he doesn't care if he's in relationship or not, he just says ""okay"" when she asked him to be in relationship everytime). They keep breaking up because of me, she's usually offended if she saw us hugging each other (which he wouldn't do with her) or acknowledging that we had sex. Their relationship is very messy, she cries and cries every night, she cuts herself, drinks to get too drunk to forget, etc and it was like that for a year. He shows no sympathy to her, he also offended and insulted her, calling her a whore and such. But he cares about me, he told me I'm the perfect girl, better than that girl by million time, really wants to live with me, and stuff like that. He never hurts me. I'm not being forceful to him at all, I don't ask for sex or come over his house, he invites me himself and it only happened like 10 times for last year. It seems that she went over his house a lot more often than me, but it's probably because she's being forceful and demand him that she's coming over, etc. He also told me that he always make her cry every time she's over, like because of he yelling my name during sex, gets all offended when she said bad things about me, and stuff like that. What's on his mind anyway?

Male, 17 years old, 11th grade. My ex dumped me three weeks ago. 'We grew distant and our lives are moving in different directions' - whatever the fuck that means. I'm still pretty heartbroken about it. And she's already dating someone else... they became facebook official on my birthday, how sweet. Anyway, to the point. We're in a selective group of 8 kids undergoing an advanced curriculum within our school. We have 6 classes and a seminar together. As a result, I have to discuss and interact with this girl every single fucking day. We have to work on chemistry labs together, communicate in socratic circles, inevitably ask each other questions - it sucks. Interacting with this girl just brings back the happy memories followed by the pain of her fulfilling someone else's dreams. She was my best friend and the one reason why I loved going to school. After the breakup, though, I now eat lunch in the library alone, I rarely talk in class anymore, and I even take different ways to class so I don't have to see her in the hallways with her douchebag boyfriend. Her best friend is in all of our classes, so my ex is fine and has her mind occupied. But me... I have nothing. This is the girl I have been talking to and flirting with every day for the whole school year. I feel so lost. I have never really connected with the other students, and now that she's gone I can't even stand going to school. I remain confident and try hiding my sadness, but on the inside I just want to leave school and never come back.

So my and my SO were dating for almost 2years, she ended up leaving 3 weeks before the 2 year mark. Things were awesome up until a couple months ago when we started our 2nd year at the university. She started to get stressed out with classes and on campus job, and began to shut me out more and more. This led to arguments about her not pulling her weight, then she would get defensive telling me I was pushing too much. There was no agreeable common ground. She wanted the isolation, even if it meant sacrificing the time we had to spend together. I am the opposite and felt like we needed to take advantage of the little time we had. Then almost 3 weeks ago, she tells me she cannot handle it and needed out. I have felt great these last few weeks, but it's getting on me hard, as every cell in my body is saying to try to get her back. Her family basically adopted me (I have a shitty home) and gave me a job (dad owns a dairy.) I miss all of that.

I've been seeing this girl for about a month now I meet her through one of my friend's girlfriends, and we really hit it off. We've been talking non stop on Facebook but I don't get to see her ever really now that school is over. The only thing we do together is when we go out to lunch at school, during which we just make out .The closest thing to a date we have had was at a school event, after school hours with the friends that set us up. The problem is that during summer I go off for the most of the summer and she doesn't want her dad to find out about us so she won't go out or anything. So her idea is to just wait until school starts again, and I don't really think I can wait that long I just want to see her once before I go but she is too afraid of her dad finding out, because she might have to move schools. We've have both told each other that we love each other. This is the first relationship like this I've been in and I'm not sure if I am being too clingy or if it's reasonable to be like this and what could I do?

I really don't know what to do, and I'm feeling frustrated and in need of some outside opinions. My bf and I have been dating for about 6 months. We've been long distance for about 2. I have never been to a club before, and my friends have invited me to go to one this weekend. This sounds fun, and I want to socialize with my friends and have a good time. I'm not looking to hook p or get blackout drunk, i just want to have a good night. My boyfriend is very much against this. All he tells me is that it's bad for relationships, and is angry I want to do this. But I'm an adult, and feel like he doesn't trust me. I've asked him what he dislikes, and he won't say except that it's bad. I've explained it's not like I want to do this every weekend, just this one time, but that doesn't matter to him. I know I should respect him, but I really want to go hang out with my friends and be social. Am I being unreasonable? Is this just a compatibility issue? I'm really at a loss of what to do.

So i've started seeing a girl I met on an app, and we've had a couple of really fun dates in which we have loads in common and I think we're well suited and i'm completely smitten. We've both come out of long distance relationships (me 3 years, her 6) over the past 6 or so months and she's mentioned that she's unsure she can handle the commitment, and recommended in passing that I go on other dates. The circumstances in which my own relationship disintegrated left me in an incredibly depressed state and I don't know if I can handle the rejection if I try to build something with her. I knew from the outset I shouldn't get attached too quickly but we get on so well i've just been caught up in it. I don't know whether to keep it casual for now, or if I should get some clarity at this early stage to see what page she's on, and if she knew how much I was into her whether this would help or hinder things. I'm happy to keep it casual for now, but am just conscious that we may be on different pages as I am quite keen. Her relationship was incredibly long so I totally understand her misgivings. I'm incredibly grateful for your advice as i'm terrifically unsure of things, especially with myself and don't want to get back into a bad place again. Many thanks,

I've been hooking up with a guy I met in the summer, and our relationship is clearly FWB, whenever we hangout either sober or drinking, we have sex. I have picked him up a few times from downtown when he's out drinking and we either stay at his or my place. Last night was the first time I called in a favor, I was out drinking and he was not. He said he could come pick me up but couldn't stay as he has things to do the next day. That's fine with me, sometimes we don't always stay the night. The car ride to my place was good, we were talking and laughing like normal. When he's dropping me off at my house I ask if he's coming in, and he declines. I wasn't going to beg him to come in so I say thanks and leave the car. I was taken aback, I thought ""couldn't stay"" would equal a quickie or something. I was drunk and embarrassingly kept texting him, we've never not had sex! I apologized in the morning for being drunk, horny, and pissed off in the texts I sent because he read them all and didn't reply, and thanked him again for picking me up. He read the apology text and still hasn't replied. I'm wondering why a fuck buddy would bother picking me up from downtown if he didn't want to sleep with me? We were just out a few nights ago with a group of friends, and we got along well and had a great night and morning after together. Did he pick me up just to solely ""repay a favor""? Why wouldn't he just say, ""sorry I'm busy tonight"" instead of literally *just* being a taxi for me? I'm confused and kind of pissed off, we've always been more of the benefits than friends and whenever he wants to hookup we do, so why not last night?

All right, first things first let me give background information, my ex (call her 'B') and my current (recently made ex? Call her 'G') partner were friends before I knew either of them met and I met G through B. I dated B for about 6 months but things fell apart and we split up. After we split up B proceeded to spread rumours amongst her friends that G and I had been fooling around her back. We hadn't. The two of us (G and I) were alienated from that group and grew closer because of it and after about a month we decided to give it a go and started going out. Things between us had been awesome, and out of the blue B messages me and says she wants to get coffee and some of my things she still had. I headed over to her place and we had a chat, I grabbed my things and was about to leave when she kissed me and tried to go down on me, I didn't resist initially because I'm an idiot but I quickly came to my senses and gtfo'd out of there. Further adding to my stupidity, I didn't tell G about this because I knew it would cause a shitstorm and I just wanted B out of my life. fast forward a few more months and G gets a message from B asking if she wanted to get coffee, G said all right as she didn't see the point in harbouring a grudge. After a few hours of expected radio silence I get a text from G that reads, ""you lied, its over."" She told me she still loved me but that it was over between us. I assume this is about the time I went to B's place because other than that I haven't been in contact with her at all. I don't know what to do right now, I'm historically not a very emotionally stable person so I'm trying to keep it together and figure out what to do/say, someone please help me.

We met at a summer job during college, and tried dating long distance (about 700 miles) but it just didn't work. She claimed she loved me but ultimately broke up with me due to the distance being hard, and she wanted to enjoy her senior year without having to deal with a long distance relationship. Now, we've ended up working in the same city. She's single and so am I. We had amazing chemistry together, and quite honestly I thought this was the girl I was gonna marry. I want to ask her on a date, but we haven't talked for a very long time, although things never got sour between us. The only bad thing about our breakup was that I took it kind of hard. A few weeks after the breakup I asked if there was anything we could do to make it work and she stuck to her guns saying that there's no point in doing long distance if we didn't know where we were going to be after college, and she didn't want to change her life plans to move for a guy. After college she went to a different part of the US to do some soul searching and I moved back to our home city to work my job. I still have her number somewhere, and we are facebook friends. She's still gorgeous to me, and I think if I saw her on the street my heart would skip a beat. I know that I should initiate contact, and just chat casually for a while before bringing anything up. But god I didn't realize I missed her so much until I heard she was back in town.

Basically I [21 M] have been friends with this girl [20 F] since high school, going into last year of uni now. Over the years it's gone from not having feelings, to having a crush (I always thought she was attractive), and then as we became pretty much best friends and especially over the past year I've pretty much fallen in love with her to the point that I think about her all the time. There were always random hookups over the years with other people and what not for both of us, but I always got over it somehow whenever she did, mainly because it wasn't actually a thing. But over the past couple weeks there has been a guy she likes and has started kinda seeing, and it's starting to ruin me. I can't stop thinking about them together, and when I'm with her and see her texting him I get depressed. Just the feeling in general that she likes someone that much and it's not me is killing me But even with this, I still do care about her so much and love her as a person. I have tons of fun with her otherwise and she's always the person I've gone to with problems and what not, and I'm going through some stuff right now which is making this even harder since when I go to her now I just keep thinking about her and that guy. I guess I always knew this time would come, but I don't know what to do now that it has. So basically, is there any way or methods people have used to get over someone like this, but still stay as best friends? Or is it just impossible without me being constantly depressed and cutting communication or distancing myself is the only way?

**Original Post:** First off - a blanket thank you to all the reassurances that I'm not a blind asshole. I read every comment, but didn't have the time to reply to each one individually. So, I met up with boyfriend again and told him that while I will not quit rock climbing I want to try and make him more comfortable. I offered to buy him a day pass to the gym so that he could see what it's like, even though he can't climb, but he said he didn't want to go. When I pressed him, he admitted to feeling self conscious lately because he's been gaining weight since his injury (torn ACL). Apparently this got worse a few weeks ago when he heard a friend and I being jealous over how hot everyone at the gym is (we can't seem to develop visible abs). I tried to reassure him that he was attractive, but don't know how successful I was. I told him I'd put overnight trips on hold until he heals and can come with. So no Yosemite, but I've been waiting long enough anyway so I figure a few more months isn't a big deal. He agreed that changing my couple's membership was unnecessary, but suggested switching to a nearby university gym with a climbing wall when it's over. I told him I didn't want to because their gym is out of the way, super expensive, and their climbing wall is small. Plus, I *like* my gym and the people there. He was miffed but let it go. I think he might bring it up again when my membership is up - but that's still a few months away so I'll cross that bridge then. If anyone has ideas on how to make him feel more attractive despite the weight gain, I'm all ears! I'm thinking maybe a special date night so he knows I'm happy being with him.

For the most part my relationship with my boyfriend is great. We have a beautiful little boy and I love and care about him very much. But, since we had our son two and a half years ago, my boyfriend has developed little or no interest in sex. He will have sex with me once a month maximum and only if I initiate it. Other than that he is perfectly content with us not having sex and laying in bed having a quick cuddle and a peck on the lips and going straight to sleep. I've brought up the issue several times. He blames it on being tired when he gets in from work or there being housework to do. Basically if there is dishes in the sink or any ironing to do he can't get in the mood. He looks at pictures of girls and saves them to his phone (people who are a lot slimmer, fitter than me. I'm a size 12) and I'm beginning to worry that because I know weigh more than I did in the past that he is no longer attracted to me and trying to sugar coat it. I don't feel as if my sex drive is a big enough issue for me to end the relationship as I feel like I'm ruining my son's chance at a happy family if I end it for that reason. Sorry this might be TMI but I've tried going to bed naked. No response. I've tried dressing up, nothing. I've tried literally everything I can think of. Any ideas for bringing the spark back?

Hey guys My ex and I broke up a few months ago after being together for 4 years. In the last month or so we have started talking and met up occasionally as friends and have had great fun, just the way we used to have. So we were speaking last week and I mentioned that we should go on a date and she said yes, but she didnt want to feel like she was being pressured right back into the exact same relationship, because we had some problems but we have both worked on those issues. The only thing is, obviously its a little different for us because we know everything about each other bar how we've changed the last few months. But after meeting her a few times I feel like she is still the same girl I fell in love with. Anyway, I had an idea for a date and wanted some opinions on it. Would be greatly appreciated. She has always wanted to go to a drive-in-cinema in the past but were we live they just come by very often. My idea was to message her and tell her that we're going out on -random day- and to bring a blanket and some pillows for the car. Then I was going to get her favourite food and bring it with us and my tablet and go somewhere quiet and watch a movie on the tablet in the car with the food. Hoping that it has some of the same atmosphere that would be at a drive in theatre. I'm hoping it would be original and possibly romantic. I posted this in dating advice too but I didn't know if i should post it here too hoping that more people could see it and generate some input on this. What do you think?

She is the one that got away. The connection we had is fading. I knew she would be in Chicago this weekend. I was afraid to ask. But I was right, she was with another guy. She is the most beautiful woman I have ever known, inside and out. She is light. She brings goodness out of everyone she meets. She glows. And she deserves to be happy, even if that isn't with me. I'm just so tired of the loneliness. I know I messed up, more than once, but I still can't blame myself for everything that's happened. I tried. I told her so many times how I feel. I just wish she would have grabbed me. Told me. Looked me in the eyes and laid it all out, for once. I'm writing this from a place of peace (or something like that). I don't have anyone else to express these feelings to. She won't ever understand and neither will anyone else. Everyone thinks I'm an asshole and that's ok with me. It still hurts to know some other guy was holding her while they watched the final Grateful Dead

Throwaway because I want to remain anonymous. My relationship with my girlfriend, let's call her Jennifer, is wonderful, and I have been planning to propose to her. I already got a beautiful ring and I have been planning to meet up with her dad to ask for his blessing for my proposal, and was planning to go through with my proposal to her between christmas and new years eve. However, two days ago I received a call from my sister, and it turns out her boyfriend just proposed to her. This was probably to be expected, as they are expecting a baby soon, and I am genuinely happy for her and them. He is a great guy. But another feeling inside me feels like I should hold off my proposal for a while because of this. I do not want to create any drama, try to steal the attention from her or anything like this. And especially now, I do not want to make it look like to family and friends that I proposed just because my sister suddenly got engaged. As a side note, to my sister everything has been a competition when growing up: how had the best grades, who were the best at sports, who landed the best jobs, etc. And as a final note, they are not aware that I was planning to propose to my girlfriend, so they could not have known. As I did not know anything of their engagement plans. Another part of me is saying just go ahead and do it. As this should not really matter. How do I approach this discreetly? Should I go ahead with my plans as planned, or wait till past new years eve?

I drove up to the college he goes to to visit some of my friends there and go to a party. I had a long-time crush on him (for 1 year) and I had flirted with him and not been...particularly subtle. I was pretty sure he was aware of my interest but had basically given up on him. Anyway, I went to the party. He turned out to also be there, but we didn't interact much. I took a few shots and as a lightweight got pretty hammered. At 2AM he texts me asking if I'm still awake. I am and I go to his room (still drunk, I thought maybe he wanted to watch TV or something). He opens the door and he is only wearing a blanket. He was also pretty obviously drunk. One thing led to another and we started kissing. I thought maybe he had finally really decided he liked me. I guess I was stupid. He suggested that we have sex, but I haven't had sex before and I was uncomfortable. Somewhere along the line, I asked him his intentions. He says he likes me as a person but doesn't like me romantically and isn't interested in a relationship. He says he wants a purely physical relationship and likes me as a person but not in any other way. He said that us having sex would be ""good practice"". I told him I didn't want to have sex, but the person putting me up was asleep and her room was locked, so I ended up sleeping in his bed with him (not doing anything sexual). And then I left in the morning to go back home. I'm pretty sadden and disappointed and I don't know how to proceed.

I'm a senior in high school and I thought I'd written off long-term relationships this year (senior year is admittedly a bad year for them). That is until the right girl came along. Made friends with her, talked a bit, hung out, and went on an implied casual date (movies, my first with any girl). Went pretty well and at the end, I asked her on a real date (dinner) and she said definitely. A week of school passed between then and when I tried to set dinner up and I guess she had a lot going through her head because she reconsidered. She said she didn't think it was a good idea to see someone at this point citing the fact that she has a lot on her plate and that graduation is just around the corner. My point here is that while it seemed as if she liked me and did *want* to go out, the commitment became daunting when combined with all of the surrounding circumstances. This mentality seems to be prevalent amongst the majority of the single girls of my age at my school (and with good reasons; busy getting into college, final semester of high school, etc.) and nobody wishes to commit to anything long term because nobody can see anything in their future ahead of June. I've gotten closure with this girl and I'm happy that we're friends now, but I'm ready to move on and maybe even try and find someone else. That being said, the pool at school is exhausted for aforementioned reasons. Where else can I look, what are my other options? Or do I just ride out the rest of the semester and wait for summer/college?

I know, I know, it is generic. We have known each other for about 5 years now, and in that time we have become the best of friends. We've established that no matter what happens in our friendship, that we will never cuddle, kiss, or have feelings for each other. But recently we have been communicating non-stop and sometimes I just feel like I may have feelings for this person. But I am afraid to say something about it or point it out in the event that she won't continue being my friend, which is what's more important to me than dating her. We were talking the other day about what we look for in a partner, and I listed some things, (I am [trait], enjoy [verb], and have [noun].) and her response to that was basically, ""But dude, I am [trait], enjoy [verb], and have [noun]."", with the EXACT same things I listed. It made me pause and think that maybe she said that in the hopes I would get a mother fucking hint. But I dunno. She told me she did some stuff with this guy, and for some reason it really set me off. And now I can't stop thinking about her, but at the same time, I know I shouldn't think about her in this way. I wish I could simply tell her how I feel. It's basic Middle school bullshit, but it's driving me nuts and starting to stress me out. It's like this little guy tugging at my shirt telling me to be sad about it and stuff, telling me to not be able to live without her.

So I have known this girl for about 2 years now and we ""hooked up"" one night two summers ago. After that for various reasons we stopped talking and had a falling out. Recently we reconnected and I took her out for some drinks. It wasn't really an official date but afterwards we ended up going back to hers and hanging out until late. When I left we kissed. Neither of us was intoxicated in the least at that moment and since it happened she seems sort of interested in seeing more of me. I asked her to lunch last week and she expressed interest but didn't seem to have time. Now I'm not bush league and I understand that she may not be interested in me. I have initiated all contact since then and she promptly responds. Is it worth pursuing or should I just get over it? Mind you the kiss happened about a week ago and I haven't seen her in person since. We both go to school together if that matters.

I've had feelings for one of my good friends for over a year. Now as we are getting to be closer, I've gone from not thinking it was possible to being wildly confused. Now I will present for you the evidence: * We are in the same program, and we plan to take our courses for this degree together. We also take 'for fun' courses together. * We routinely get lunch, hang out, study, watch movies. * A couple weeks ago we planned to get dinner and see a movie because we agreed we didn't hang out enough without school being involved. He bought my dinner saying it was to repay me for letting him access a tutoring site I use. Still, he has has bought me lunch several times recently without such motivation. I'm just very confused. On one hand, I'm very much into him and would really like to date him. I'm not desperate or horny due to my wonderful FWB. This guy is just the first guy in the better part of a year I'm interested in having a relationship with. My main fear is just jumping the shark and asking him on a date properly and him being uninterested and thus ruining the relationship with awkward.

We had been friends for 2 years she had been with almost all my friends and was a known sloot. So I knew who she was going in she is a party girl that can't be trusted. Despite knowing all that I decided to start dating her because she was best friend and we had fun together and a hell of a lot more fun once the crazy sex started. The first month of dating was great even though my friends warned me over and over again that this girl is absolutely insane but I was blinded by a new relationship and awesome sex. Everything was going great until she said she got black out drunk and woke up next to some guy. This is obviously a red flag to get the hell out of there but my dumb ass was hooked on this girl. As the months go I forgive and forget about that whole incident but like I said before she is party girl that can't pace herself and gets blackout drunk and god knows what she does. I get several phone calls a night of her just talking complete drunken gibberish it's incredibly annoying but I'm in love now so I just deal with this because I'm a dumb ass. So earlier this week I started to see clearly again got myself out of her spell. I confront her on all her bullshit and she gets mad and shuts down. I get a text a few hours later saying ""Going to the hospital"" with 2 pictures attached which were of her arm sliced 10 times and blood everywhere. This was incredibly upsetting to receive and not to mention very immature to send me such graphic things. So what I'm trying to figure out is how to get out of this relationship. I'm obviously being emotionally manipulated but I'd rather that keep happening than her take her life. She may be shitty to me but I don't want her to die.

Hi guys! I've recently joined into /r/relationships and I need some advice in talking to my roommate. We're currently undergrads at a university, and we were originally planning to find an apartment together, I've noticed that what we want is pretty different. While price is important to me, I'd much rather have a safe and conducive study environment (meaning that I have to be comfortable), and don't mind the distance. To her, price is far more important and she cares a LOT about distance to the campus (she doesn't like walking more than 15 mins if possible). Most importantly she's moving in with a friend with whom I'm not particularly close with. It's not that I dislike her, it's just we have such conflicting personalities I do not feel comfortable around her, and know that when I live with her (she was my roommate for two years), frustrations start to build up. So recently I've begun to look for apartments with other roommates. My problem is how do I tell her without making it seem like I'm ditching her? We're friends, but I wouldn't say we're particularly very close friends (I talk to her about issues but I can't comfortably just be myself around her), and I was wondering if there's a nice way to break it to her? Also as a side note, she is fairly sensitive and doesn't really have a tough shell. At all. I would like to do it soon because I don't want to leave her and her friend hanging right before the school year starts. Both she and her family have been very sweet to me over the last few years (I'm international), and I don't want to lose this friendship.

I am a 24 year old college student. Female. I have been in an 10 year ""relationship"" (only official when we went to college and got our own apartment) with my step brother Kyle. He's 25. We started messing around in high school. We never told anyone, though I think my step dad might have some suspicions. Since I chose to forgo my 1st choice university to go to the one Kyle chose. It worked out for the best because I ended up switching majors when I learned nursing was boring as fuck to me. I have a teaching degree. Kyle and I love the town. We have been sharing an apartment since we graduated HS and our parents are always asking if we are ""dating"" (other people, not each other) or if we are going to come home for the holidays. I have lied about dating before just to throw her off. We do. But it is always super awkward because they want to ask us all these personal questions and I want to be honest. It is not like we were raised from small kids together. Kyle still sees his mom, who knows and has never told his dad. I don't know my bio dad. Our parents married 12 years ago. So we were pretty much no longer children by this point. So, I always just viewed him as the cute guy down the hall. And it happened. I am very much in love with him and he said he wants to propose. I have agreed. I want to be with him, in the open. I am just not sure how to tell my mom and step dad about this.

My(24) boyfriend(23) and I have been together for over 4 years and we have a daughter. We have been arguing lately and after one heated argument I decided to go to my parents house for a while, as I packed my bf did nothing and said nothing he even fell asleep. After I left and picked up daughter from nursery to go to my parents he texted me a little and then nothing. He then tells me that he is going to visit his family by buss and that he had purchased a ticket. Fast forward and the day that he is scheduled to go he ignores my calls all day to then finally tell me he is actually in a different place altogether visiting friends. He won't give me a reason for going there and said that he lied so I wouldn't be mad... What should I make of this? What should I do?

Hello /r/relationships, I've finally decided to ask for advice regarding a problem that has been bothering me ever since I started my second year of college. I'm in a healthy relationship with my first girlfriend who I met on campus in my freshman year of college. We both have a lot of similar interests, and, though she can be a bit hard to talk to sometimes, we solve any problems bothering us together. Here's the problem though, recently I feel different in the relationship. It's like i have to keep reminding myself that I love her on a daily basis. It's like the magic of the first few months is wearing off, and it bothers me. I talked to a friend (who has been in a relationship for 2 years) and she said this was normal. I want to think it's a phase that I'll grow out of, but it honestly scares me thinking about what could happen if I fall out of love with my girlfriend. Like I said earlier, we both have a lot in common, and she's really in love with me (to the point that sometimes it's hard to get her off me) which I think is awesome. My girlfriend may be my first, but she really is one of the greatest people I've ever met so far, and I'd hate to see this relationship fall apart because of me. I want this to work between us, and I want to love her and treat her like gold. Please /r/relationships, I need advice on how to get closer to someone special that I want to love as much as possible.

A few months ago I met a girl on OKC and we became friends on Facebook. We hit it off fairly well I think and IMed for a bit, each time for several hours. A week ago I asked her if she wanted to hang out over the weekend and she said yes. While talking about what we wanted to do she asked if I was intending this to be a date or a platonic hang-out. I said either is fine and she said ""lol I only ask because my mom told me to tell every boy that takes me out of the house that I'm dating other people."" I said that was fine and we continued to make plans. We set a time, planned to get dinner, and she gave me her address and number. We wound up chatting for a couple of hours after that until I had to leave. An hour or so later she messaged me and said she had to cancel because she just found out her dad was working that day and she had to watch her mother (who has MS). She seemed genuinely apologetic and said ""I'm sorry. I hope you don't mind rescheduling. :("" Of course, I said that'd be fine. I messaged her a couple of days later and asked if she wanted to see The Hobbit. She said yeah, seemed excited, and said she'd ask her parents. The problem is that she never got back to me. I'm afraid to message her again because I don't want to seem clingy or pushy. I'm not quite sure if this was a way of letting me down easy. She does seem to have a habit of dropping off the face of the internet for a few days.

So a year or so ago I started talking to this girl. We'd go out every week have coffee, dinner, see a movie you name it. But we never put a boyfriend/girlfriend stamp on it even though we both acknowledged that we liked each other like that. So after this dragged on for about 5 months I sat her down and basically just asked her if we were dating or not. She swore up and down that she liked me, told me everything she liked about me. Hell, she told her friends that she did. She said she was worried about making time for me between school and work which I understood (She got out at 3 and worked almost daily until 8-9) After that things fizzled out. We stopped talking. For 14 months. Until today. I realized I had something of hers in my car so I text her and tell her I have this thing and she tells me it's not a big deal. But she also tells me that she's really glad I texted her and that she missed me. We talked about school next year and she reiterated over and over again how I should move in with her. (She also lives with her sister and even asked how much rent would be for me just in case I decide to. (She also said her sister was ecstatic. Her sister really likes me) So I guess my real question is, what's up with her? I really don't get it. I wouldn't mind getting back together because shes's a wonderful girl but I can't put my finger on what tonight was all about.

I'm pissed about this. I think it is complete bullshit. Her shitty company has passed her up three times this year for promotions. One time for an outside hire. She gets glowing reviews, she's smart, and has a lot more to offer than what she's doing now. She always preps before the interviews, goes over possible questions and answers. We would run mock interviews every day up until the interview. They always give her bullshit answers when she asks for feedback on why she didn't get the jobs. ""You were great, but we think the person who got it has more experience."" Shit like that. I almost feel like she should just quit, and tell the whole place to go fuck themselves. I make more than three times what she does and could easily support us. What can I do to make her feel better? She's really sad. I think she should get pissed, but that's not really her. Help?

I had a one night stand with a coworker. We both agreed that it would be just for fun, and it was fun indeed, although sex was just OK. Not because she was bad in bed, but I felt we lacked chemistry. She proposed having a FWB relationship, but I declined. At work, things were a bit weird too, so I thought it would be best to not continue that path. A week later, I found her while going out. We were pretty drunk, one thing led to another... and we had sex again. Now, sex was not good at all, but apparently she loved it both times. She insinuated that she wanted a FWB relationship again, and I said ""we'll see"". It's been a few days. I will have to tell her that I do not want that, and I will have to offer her a reason. I don't want to hurt her feelings. I don't think she was bad in bed, we are just not for each other. Any advice?

Me and my boyfriend have been together for about 2 years, and living together with roommates for about 1 year. I've loved being able to be together everyday, coming home to one another, sleeping together, and everything about being with him. Our lease is up in 6 months and he wants to move back in with his parents. He says for financial reasons although he's only paying rent right now while his parents pay his car insurance, phone bill, and everything else. If he moves back home I'm basically forced to move back into my grandparents house and share a room with my 16 year old sister and sleep in a twin sized bed.. alone... I've cried myself to sleep almost every night thinking about how bad it will be. My home life is also pretty toxic and I'm very happy to be away from it. I know I can't force him to do anything he doesn't want to but I guess I just don't get why he would want to move back home. I haven't really told him how upset I am because I don't want to be unreasonable or put him down.

That event comes around i give him his present, he's forgotten mine. I ask however many days later when he intends on buying me anything and i get ""That even has passed."" I can tell that the real reason is that he forgets, or he spends all of his money on absolutely useless things (A crossbow that he said he'd use for hunting, and hasn't.)

I'm taking his summer class. Lately we are getting to know each other more like friends than teacher/student relationship, and things are actually more casual than professional between us (in the classroom). He tries to keep it very professional (he never crosses a line that shouldn't be crossed), but there's a lot of chemistry/attraction between us. If he wasn't my teacher, we would probably be friends. I'm his favorite student and we often kid around/friendly banter. He teases me a lot and we joke around often. The other day he saw me walking with a guy friend of mine and he brought it up the same day if he was my boyfriend. I immediately denied and said he was just a friend, and he said I was flustered or something (but I wasn't! He was just saying that to tease me :( ). I try not to flirt outrightedly because I don't think it's appropriate, but he always smiles when he sees me/talks to me/is around me and doesn't do that with anybody else (at least not nearly as much). At the beginning it was kind of awkward because we would pretty much make eye contact for most of the class and we would laugh (it was really awkward) when we caught each other looking at each other. Now we're getting to know each other better. He's only 6 years older than me and I'm over the age of consent, and I would never do anything while he's still teaching me obviously because of the ethical reasons, but I'm wondering if it would be unethical if something were to happen after the class was over...? Opinions?

Hey, um. This is really weird because i've never thought i needed help and honestly i've always needed help. I have always been kind of a polyamorous person, Honestly it's gotten me in a lot of trouble because i think it ended up making me a chronic cheater. I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 8 months, our relationship was very hard and very fast to begin and we're really kind of settling down now. (we got a place together in March) When we started the relationship (Oct/Nov) i told her i have problems being faithful and it's something that i honestly didn't think i could help. She helped by being honestly the best girlfriend i've ever had. i told her i'd maybe like an open relationship and she said probably not but she'd think about it. I let it be and didn't do anything for a lot longer than i usually do. April rolls around and we've been dating almost 6 months, i tell her i'm going to visit my best friend in Edmond (about 2 hours from Tulsa, where i live) and i'd be home that night. needless to say i cheated on her and told my best friend to keep it mum, like an asshole. I got home that night and told her i'd like to see my best friend from time to time and she said she needed to think about it, she got on messenger and talked to her and they discussed it, i got a lot of heck from my bestie to tell her, so the next day i did. She figured i did, and i felt terrible. we made up and she told me not to do it again. fast forward to today, i do it again, with a different girl. honestly, i'm just trying to figure out what makes someone do these things and how they can stop. I really love her and want to spend a long time with her, but i feel like this is seriously hurting me.

Two weeks ago her brother came to visit and brought her a lot of pills to repay a debt? I think they're called norcos?. She has been irritable and bizarre mood swings ever since. On Friday we were at a cookout with my friends, she showed up wasted and ended up making a scene and embarrassing me. At one point someone asked my friend, we'll call Jake, who isn't the most socially aware person how we knew each other and he said through my ex. When I first met my gf, I had told her I knew her through mutual friends. She asks me about it, we get over it. Saturday morning, we're cuddling in bed. I go to get food with a friend. She brings up the Friday night incident and says shes needs some space. I give her space. No texts, no calls. Since then she has been all over the place. Her close friend also mentioned to me that she thought she had been acting very different and thought it was drugs. She is prescribed klonopin and adderal. But has been taking norcos (not prescribed) every day. Last night she called and admitted she was ""fucked up"". Slurring words. She said that she finally feels in touch with herself when on all those pills. Crying saying she doesn't love me anymore. When just last week she woke me up at 5AM and had the most real feeling heart to heart I've ever experience in a relationship. We had plans to visit my family. To take a vacation this summer. We were excited and always planning new things. I'm at a loss. In a few weeks my relationship of 10 months has been destroyed. She used to like to go out on adventures. But when I mention things we had planned for this summer.. they are ""retarted"" and ""fucking stupid"". It's so frustrating cuz I know what a great person she can be. I don't take any pills so I can't wrap my head around where she is. . Is this fixable? Is it not really drugs and she's really just done with the relationship? How can I support her to get her back to where we were?

So some background me and this girl have been going out for roughly 4 month while at college and what not and everything was perfect. then came summer break. She went on one holiday for a week and we called and texted like normal. Then another one week holiday after that, but the communication slowed down. I had seen her once and that was 2 weeks ago and she was somewhat mean and very short tempered ( She was on her period). For that week we didnt talk at all and when i had asked her what was wrong she said that she did not want to talk to anyone atm. So i gave her space.. But then recently i text her asking if we could meet up because we hadnt talked in a while and shes now gone travelling to Amsterdam untill the weekend randomly which i had no idea about, but she thought she had told me? We have a dinner arrange on the monday with her family in London and im not sure what to do. Whenever i text her she doesnt reply for hours if not the next day, and if its a reply it is blunt and very passive. Do i just wait and see whether she messages me before the dinner or do i just end it because shes been treating me like shit for the last month?

Let me start off by saying this is a long distant relationship and her best friend is also long distant. I met my GF though him playing games and what not. They had a thing going for awhile but nothing serious. He has helped her though rough times when her brother past. I have visited her twice for a week each and there was no jealousy at all. Just online. I've caught her in the past messaging him about cuddles. This extremely upset me and I confronted her about it. I have yet to see her saying anything like that to him again. Although I still get jealous. They talk a lot and maybe even more than us. Like I said she says he's her best friend. My girlfriend and I go on skype because long distant and everyday she wants to add him to call. I forgot to mention she doesn't want to tell him that were boyfriend and girlfriend because he will not ever talk to her again. He is really the only person she talks to so I dont want to take that away from her. I love this girl to death and of course want to be with her but should I work on my jealousy?

Okay, this started last Christmas when my grandma lost my lightsaber and obviously I was upset cause it was given to me by my favourite relative as a graduation gift. My step brother (17M) overheard my conversation with my mom about buying a new one which he told my step dad about and complained that instead of buying expensive things, why couldn't I just use the money to pay for rent in our house. Now, except for my mom, nobody knows that I pay a part of the electricity and we keep it quiet cause my step dad gets upset that my mom makes me pay for utilities. Anyway, my step dad got mad at my mom for allowing me to buy expensive things which I don't understand cause I'm already working and have a sizeable savings account. My mom told me about it and we had a conversation about how my step brother shouldn't care what I do with money since I work hard for it. My step dad gets mad at my mom when he found out and asked me, my mom, and my half brother (4M) to get out of the house. My mom now gets mad at me for even suggesting to buy a replacement lightsaber and blames me that I'm so spoiled. After a couple of days, my mom and my step dad reconcile but with the condition that I move out of the house and I asked my mom why and my step dad says it's because I don't contribute anything to the house. Which brings me to my question, should I move out and rent a room or just pay the rent I'm going to pay for a room to my step dad? But my worry is that my step family treats my half brother like shit and my step dad acts like he doesn't care and my mom can't do anything about it. Should I let my mom choose between me and my step dad cause I'm seriously getting frustrated how my step dad is so fucking inconsistent?

My 21 year old sister moved into an apartment on her own almost a year ago. Her apartment doesnt come with a washer/dryer but it does have hookups. When my sister first moved in, I let her do laundry at my house once a week to help her out a little till she got a washer and dryer. Well its been almost a year and shes still doing laundry at my house, which wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that my boyfriend and I live together in his house. Shes an LNA and works nights, so shell come to my house whenever she has time during the day to do laundry when my boyfriend and I are both at work. Sell lounge around on my couch and watch my cable and netflix. This gets awkward when my boyfriend comes home on lunch, or will get home from work early and my sister is there lounging on the couch watching TV. At this point, I feel like shes being extremely rude and my boyfriend is sick of her coming over when ever she wants to use our washer and dryer. I totally understand his frustration, because I would hate it if the roles were reversed. Now let me also point out that she has a very misbehaved badly trained Shepard that shits all over her apartment, and she uses TOWELS to clean it. Guess where she tries to wash those towels...IN MY MACHINES EWWWW. She doesnt think shes being rude, She thinks that because shes my sister I owe it to her and its ok for her to do whatever she pleases. I feel bad, but im at the point where im ready to tell her she needs to start using a laundromat or get her own machines. I know its my house, but What do I say to this girl without sounding like a cold hearted bitch??

I've been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year now. He's very sweet and funny. We have a great relationship except I don't like the way he talks about other women. The first instant happened prior to us even dating. My former best friend (and roommate) was in a class with him. They were in the same group for a project. He told me one time that while they were giving a presentation, she was sitting backwards in a chair, and he said that he got an image of him fucking her from behind in that chair. Needless to say, I was pissed. Then he tells me that he also wanted to fuck my other roommate, who he never thought was that attractive. These instances happened a year ago, and I have since let it go. But, sometimes I think about it and it makes me so angry. I feel like I have no right to be mad though because it was prior to us dating and it was so long ago. Now, he doesn't make comments about my friends, but he does make comments about actresses. I get that it shouldn't make me mad because they are actresses and he will never meet them anyway. But, I've always been insecure about my body so it makes me sad. Specifically, he told me that he was excited that Emma Watson might show her boobs in a movie that she is working on. He also told me that Tommen was so lucky to be fucking Maergery from game of thrones. There are more smaller instances. I think I might be overreacting though, since none of these instances happened in the last 6 months. But, it makes me angry to this day. He says that he is working on the issue. I just don't know what to think. He is great most of the time. The comments seem bad but none of them are recent. Other than all this I love him dearly and our relationship is wonderful. I could be just insecure. I don't know.

Hello ! So I met this girl ~ 4 months ago, as a coworker doing an internship. She was reaaally shy, always fearing to talk to me, and only gave me his number in an enveloppe on my bag at the end of her internship. We talked a lot, I asked her few times for a drink but she wasnt so ready as she said... But she kept texting and even more sexting after that (she was on the offensive, with many dirty snapchat / sms), but we can't see each other for sex (long distance). Now she's back here, doing a replacement. She texted me back in order to get few infos about job. I king of ""relaunched"" her with messages before she arrives. She wasnt so on the offensive as she did, but open for a ""fun"" relationship if that happened. Problem is, I can't ""isolate"" her from other coworker + she's veeeery shy. Trying to ""tickle"" her with messages, she's more cold and more ""friendly"" than she was. I haven't yet tried to go to dirty messages as she did, I really pref the standard way... Any suggestion / help ? I'm still running out of ideas..

I have this guy at work who keeps asking me to hang out with him after work. He insists it's strictly platonic and that he just wants to be friends and get to know him better. One, I don't really believe his intentions are platonic - he acts like he has a crush on me. Two, I don't want to be his friend; I find him annoying and immature. I've been saying no to these outings, but he asks ""why not"" and insists that it's purely friendly. I end up saying things like ""I'm too busy"" or ""I have other plans,"" because I can't come up with a way to say ""I don't want to be your friend"" without sounding like a bitch. I'm not sure how to politely tell him no, and stop asking me to go out, it's never happening. I think he's getting the impression from my excuses that there's still a chance, but I don't know how to answer why not without being mean.

I started dating this girl a few weeks ago and we've been on four dates so far. The first three were amazing and we connected super well. We kissed on our first date, we've cuddled, made out, and we always hold hands when we're together. I even gave her a gift last week and she said it was the best thing she'd ever gotten and that made me feel so good. We still held hands and kissed on our fourth date, but she was a lot quieter. I asked her why she'd been quiet lately and she said it's because she isn't in a good place emotionally for a relationship and that she's not ready to be in one. I know she's had bad experiences before, and I told her that I understood why she wasn't ready and that I promised her I wouldn't give up on her or leave her. But the thing is, I still want to be with her. So badly. And if she wants to wait I will wait for her until she's ready to be in a relationship. I just don't know if she wants me to wait or if she's trying to let me go. I'm one of the only people she's ever opened up to which is why I want to show her that she can trust me and that I mean what I say. I was thinking about asking her out to a movie and dinner this weekend, would this still be a good idea? If we do go out, should I still kiss her and hold her hand? I'm not sure what to do here and any advice would be helpful.

Me (16M) fucked it all up with a gurl. Me and grill have been talking a lot recently, and each day we've gotten closer. So, since it finals week, she said that she would be up to come to my place and watch Netflix and cuddle and shit (and no ""netflix and chill"" jokes, there was no sec however we did suck face). I said sure, even though I was a little uncomfortable doing that without us being in a declared relationship. So, after this we both agreed we had a good time, and texted for the rest of the day and all that jazz. However, as I was talking to her today, I brought up the topic of us dating, which she replied with ""I'm not interested in dating for a while yet"". This confused me, since we have been doing things are typical of couples, and nothing would change about relationship besides the title. So, she now feels like bad because ""she went too far"" and won't text me back. I've made multiple attempts to apologize for bringing up the topic, but I think I'm done trying to text her today. I'm spending time writing a real long and thoughtful text for her in the morning. Is it done? Did I do a bad?

In the beginning of the relationship my then boyfriend/now husband would go down on me on a somewhat regular basis. I get the impression he wasn't totally excited to do it but he knew I liked it so he would throw it in every now and then. Ever since I got pregnant about 2 years ago he completely stopped going down on me. I was hoping after the baby was out and I was all back to ""normal"" he would start throwing it in every now and then but nope. My baby is now 14 months old and it still hasn't happened. I haven't said a word to him about it this whole time and tried to just enjoy what he was willing to give me and what I could give him. Finally last night he expressed concern for his hand not being able to get me off. I explained to him how oral was what really turned me on. He freaked out and started accusing me of trying to force him to give me oral. Everything I said got twisted into me trying to guilt trip him or trying to force him to do something he doesn't want to. I kept trying to tell him I was just trying to share what I enjoyed. He just couldn't see it and was so defensive. I just don't understand this thinking at all. I am so happy to do most things and am turned on just knowing it turns him on. It breaks my heart that he doesn't seem to care about what I enjoy. The thought of never getting oral again is hard to swallow too. I want to make this work for both of us somehow but have no idea where to go from here. Any advice for this situation? What can I say/do to connect and work with my husband on this issue?

Background: I'm a pretty shy guy. I'm a Comp Sci major and I play Dota 2 constantly. However, I guess I've ""blossomed"" here recently, because I've been getting a lot more female attention, and I don't have the experience to know how to handle many of the situations I've come across. The friend in question (we'll call her ""B"") is a girl I've been close to since I was 16, and though I once asked her out (and was rejected) we've never had anything that was more than platonic. So, I went to a party last night (in reality just a small gathering of my close-knit group of friends) and of course there was alcohol, so I start drinking upon arrival, as does everyone else. Immediately B starts flirting with me, and before long we're on the couch cuddling and talking in between bouts of sloppy drunk tongue-wrestling. At this point I only recall a few things we said to each other, though I distinctly remember B saying she should have dated me in high school instead of the guy she went out with shortly after rejecting my offer. We were both too drowsy for sex, but B insisted we go to bed together and I end up sharing one with her and another girl we're close friends with (oddly enough the girl I was pining for before all of this happened). We slept as close as we possibly could all night, with her often grabbing and holding my hand or putting her leg across my waist. In the morning we laid together and cuddled for a while and nothing seemed weird between us, though we didn't discuss what happened. I kissed her before I left and she seemed somewhat surprised, but pleased. Now, I'm unsure of how to handle the situation. Should I write it off as drunken debauchery or try to figure out where exactly we stand? Should I talk to her about it first or let her initiate the conversation? Personally, I wouldn't mind exploring this new direction in our relationship, but I don't know how or if I should relay these feelings.

I've been with my GF for 2 year since we were both 17. She is my first serious long time GF and I'm her second. We fell very deeply in love and had plans about living together after high school and go to college in the same town. Our relationship is great but not perfect and I care a lot about her. I could see us go the distance. **My problem:** Last night a female friend of mine declared that she had strong feelings for me, and we've been talking a lot to each other lately. She's a type of girl I could see myself with, but I've just seen her as a friends of course. Learning this has really twisted my mind. Suddenly I've been having second thoughts about my current relationship and the fact that I don't see myself ""settling down"" with my first ever GF. I mean, I'm 19 after all. **Here is my question:** Is this a reason enough to break up? I feel like I'm wasting my GF's time if I'm planning to end it some time later, especially since she's planning on going the distance with me. Our relationship is good and steady and I can't even imagen what it would be like to end it. Am I a douchebag? Please help me here...

Background: I met this girl through a friend a little over a month ago (maybe a month and a half?) (we all go to the same school), and have talked to her a few times. She's extremely nice, funny, pretty, likes a lot of things I do, yadda yadda yadda. I asked if she wanted to grab coffee a couple weeks back, we did and talked for around an hour. The next week, I made plans for us to go to dinner together for our club's dinner. We weren't very specific on the time, I ended up getting there around 20 minutes late (I fucked up, I know). I saw the seat next to her was empty but had a purse on it, so I sat a few seats away. Then someone asked if anyone was sitting there, she said no, and moved it, it was her bag. So I messed up bad there. I apologized after that (she forgave me, there were plenty of other people to talk to) and made plans to hang again. She and I are outdoorsy types, so I brought up the idea of going kayaking and she agreed. We did that and had a great time. I'm really starting to like her, so last week I said ""Can I take you out to dinner"", and she seemed a bit surprised but said yes. So my plan is to have an impromptu picnic at the lake with gourmet sandwiches from the local sandwich shop (which I know she likes), and some wine to make it extra special. Near the end of that, I'm planning to tell her I see her as more than a friend and want to be more than a friend. Is this too much for a first dinner date? I figured it would be more special doing that than just going out to dinner. What do you guys think?

My girlfriend and I have an 8 year gap that is usually not a problem, but I don't know if I am being unreasonable when it comes to hanging out with her older brothers. Whenever she wants them to come over to our place or she wants to hang out with them I usually try to opt out and she resents me for that. Don't get me wrong, they are good people; I honestly just don't have anything in common with them. I understand that it's her family and that a day of hanging out with them won't kill me, but they're very heavy drinkers and my girlfriend drinks a lot when she's with them too and I personally don't like it when people get to that point. I used to do that when I was in my early 20s and now I find it unhealthy as I am also trying to lose a few pounds for a trip my girlfriend and I are taking in a few weeks. I love my girlfriend and she's always down to hang out my brother [28M] and my parents [48F and 49M], and I don't know how I would feel if she were to avoid hanging out with them. Her brothers have been aggressive in the past and they like to talk shit to each other when they're drunk and start fights. Whenever her whole family gets together though I am always there and I don't have any problem with hanging out with her sister [36F] and her husband who also like to drink but it's way more relaxed. So, am I wrong? What should I do? Any help/suggestion will be appreciated.

This girl, let's call her Kay, had been going after him for at least a year before we met, but they were never really friends because she's quite immature compared to him and just wasn't what he was looking for. When we started dating she started spreading rumors about me and talking shit about me to her friends and even some of my friends! She texts him almost every day, usually without reply from him, (at least from what he's told me) and tells him how much she wishes he was single and how much she wants to be with him. Last night he told me via text that Kay has been asking to hang out with him and that he sort of wanted to do it. I immediately told him I wasn't comfortable with that at all, and he actually questioned why I wasn't comfortable with it. Are you serious? I trust him, but not her. Not at all. She's considerably skinnier and prettier than I am which already makes me uncomfortable with him talking to her. I told him this and he basically told me, ""Yeah, you're right, but looks aren't everything."" I almost cried when he told me that. I would never tell him that he couldn't hang out with her, because that's a bitch move, but rather that I am extremely uncomfortable with that. I don't want to seem controlling. Ever since he told me this I have felt completely worthless and disgusted with myself. I don't know how to make this feeling go away. Did I make the right decision by telling him this? Was I too harsh? Should I tell him I'm okay with it and just let it happen?

So back in December of 2013, I made friends with this really cool chick. We got along well, shared similar interest in bands and hobbies, etc. The friendship always had an ebb and flow due to life and what not, like most friendships do. We have a good history together. We spent lots of time one on one, she wrote me from jail whenever she got locked down, and we spent a lot of time after she got out. She even has told me that I'm ""one of her best friends."" Anyways, back in March or April of this year, our conversations just kinda dropped. I didn't want to persue it because I didn't want to be annoying or creepy. Around late March, I sent a text reaching out and asking her if I did anything wrong. She assured me that there wasn't. I asked her if she wanted to go to a comedy show, and she said she had to work that day. Late April or Early May, I sent her a text saying ""Hey, kinda random ,but I miss hanging out with you. Are you still going to local shows anymore or are you kinda done with that scene?"" - She never replied. I was just like ""Fuck it. If she doesn't want to talk to me. So be it."" But seeing as we were good friends, she still crosses my mind and I wonder how she is, how's her life been, and if I did anything to mess anything up, and what I can do to make amends. I'm just not sure what to do. I know I should just let it go and move on, but it is really bothering me.

He has done this a few times. Last night was kind of a deal breaker for me but I just want to make sure I am not overreating. Also note I am 4 weeks pregnant with his child. We have been seeing each other only a few months. Lats night immediately after we had sex, he hopped up, put clothes on and claimed to be going to the gym at 1AM. He finally comes back at 5:45 AM, and I ask him how his workout went. He said he didn't go. He said he went to 2 different gas stations (he works 3rd shift at one of them) and then he sat in a parking lot by himself for a little while. Before he left we weren't particularly having any problems, and we have a good relationship. But this is the 3rd or so time he just leaves me alone. It really bothers me. Is this normal? I have never seen anything like it. He seems very sneaky and it worries me to pieces.

So as you all may remember from [here] I asked a girl out and she didn't get back to me for several days. Well, against my best judgment I texted her again (I HATE double texting) and asked her if everything was alright because it had been a few days since I'd heard from her. Well long story short she apologized profusely because she's just been insanely busy lately. I told her that it was all good but that I was also gonna be crazy busy this week because work is giving me more hours but I would still like to get dinner if we both get some free time. Her response was ""okay! I'll let you know when I get some free time."" So... yeah. Pretty anti-climatic resolution. Not sure where to go from here (since she was too busy to remember to text me the first time, I don't have high hopes that she'll remember this time either, nor do I know how I'm supposed to handle it if she forgets *again*) But yeah. She wasn't intentionally ignoring me, and I'm still not sure she's overly happy with the idea, but she didn't say no straight up, so I guess that's a good thing?

So I'm into online role-playing. It's not an exclusively sexual thing but it can be. If you're not familiar with it, it's basically where you and another person write a story from the perspective of characters you create. It's lots of fun and I really enjoy it. A couple years ago I started role-playing with a new girl and we decided to start including sex scenes, which progressed to writing straight-up erotica. It's a lot of fun and I really enjoy it. The thing is, I'm seeing a new guy and he doesn't like it, at all. He told me it's like I'm cheating on him and I'm not sure how to feel. It's like my porn. It's what gets me off. I have a lot of trouble orgasming and this is the one kind of stimulation that really gets me going when I masturbate. Before I discovered RPing I just didn't masturbate. I don't have any sexual or intimate connection with my partner herself, and it's not really her that I'm getting off to so much as the fictional fantasies. But I understand he's uncomfortable with me interacting sexually with another person even if we aren't in any kind of relationship. And it's not like I'm rejecting him for my RP partner. We have sex at least a couple times a week and I don't feel that this has an impact on my ability to have a healthy sexual relationship. So he's given me an ultimatum. Either I stop role-playing altogether - even the non-sexual stuff - or we stop dating. And I know it sounds selfish, but I'm not sure about this. Role-playing is one of my hobbies and I don't think he should have a say in that if it's not sexual. He's not comfortable with me having any interaction with my partner at all. I really like him and it's been a great three months so far, and I don't want to lose him. Advice?

So I have known both guys for about 2 months, and we all are friends. We will call them Steve (27) and Alex (20). Well about a month ago I had gone out with Steve and a few other of our friends for drinks and ended up sleeping with Steve at the end of the night. We slept together after that again, but then he hurt me by hitting on someone while I was there and sleeping with her while I was in the next room over and could hear. None of our other friends knew Steve and I slept together, so I couldn't really talk to any of them about it. So I basically ignored Steve for a little bit and started spending more time with Alex and getting closer with him. There was another night after this that a bunch of us were all supposed go hang out but it ended up being just Steve and I, and against my better judgement, I slept with him again. I beat myself up for it, but swore to myself I would never let it happen again. So I start spending more time with Alex again, and we start dating. As of today, my period is a week late, and I have always had a 100% regular period. I keep track of my period and sexual activity using a period and ovulation tracker. The last time I slept with Steve was during ovulation, and it is not possible that Alex would be the father if I am pregnant. I'm taking a test tomorrow with my sister (24) for some moral support, but have no idea how to even *begin* to address the situation. Alex knows my period is late, and he knows I had slept with someone shortly before things developed between us, he just doesn't know it was Steve. Basically I think I'm just freaking out and have no idea what direction to go, or just any helpful advice on what I should do. The relationship with Alex is so new that we haven't discussed any sort of grand plans, and honestly I'm unsure of if he would want to stay with me if I am pregnant.

I have been with my wife for 11 years. After one year together she pressured me into marrying her. After 2 years she pressured me into having a kid (she already had a daughter). Right after my son was born she got into a deep depression. It was very bad. For 3 years it was a living hell. I slept on the couch, literally for 3 years until we moved to a new house and I got my own room in the basement. For 3 years after my son was born we fought almost daily. She wanted one more kid but she could not pressure me into having another one. Don't get me wrong, even after all we went through I would still have that child. He's the best thing that ever happened to me. I love him to death. Quite literally. Id give him my hearth if he needed one. Sad thing is I have grown to hate his mother. I cant even say I don't love her anymore. I strait up hate her, most of the time. We are still intimate once in a while. I try to initiate sex once in a while just so she doesn't complain. We moved to another country a year ago. Its been better ever since. Mainly because my work keeps me away from home at least 14 days a month. I still saw my son a lot when I got home. And my wife and I did't fight as much....Until recently Now even when I am away we fight on Skype almost daily. There is no escape. I want to leave her but I don't want to lose my son or my new job. I know that this is an awesome opportunity for everyone and it would suck to lose it all. What do I do ? Do i suck it up a few more years or end it now. English isn't my first language btw.

Im 26 and I think I am a pretty nice guy. I am funny, intelligent, adventurous, successful, fashionable, loyal, and honest. I was engaged to my last girlfriend for 6 months before she left me for her ex (long story). Prior to that, I was single for 5 years. In my teenage years, I was very prolific. I used to tour with various bands and sometimes I was with a different girl every night. It isn't something I am proud of or brag about, but it's just how things were. That being said, I don't do that anymore. I try not to have random hookups and I really delay the sex. Its been about a year since my ex ditched me, and I feel like I am ready to go out and meet people, but I am (understandably?) cautious about opening up to somebody again. I don't drink, so bars aren't really my scene. Im not even sure people find meaningful relationships in those places. I just moved to a new city where I really don't know too many people. I want to meet a woman but I am not sure how to even go about doing this since I never had to go through that stage when I was a teenager (women were just always around). It seems like the women I do meet are just interested in a fuck and flee. I want more. I am just beginning to think theres a defect in me. Help?

Hasn't been that long since I posted, but it came around to the evening and I couldn't hold it in for the weekend to confront her in person so I called her, and we talked for quite a while. I said the relationships been in a bad place for a few months and I read the messages. She wasn't sure what I meant by it and when I told her she didn't feel that it was flirting but it looks that way from the way it's written, and she never meant to hurt me. It gets fuzzy on the details, she did say got curious. Later I told her it hurts knowing she has feelings for someone else, and she said they don't mean anything compared to the ones she has for me, she will always love me. Concerning the relationship stuff she said I need to talk to her about this stuff more. I told her all the stuff and it was a mix of not realising or not doing it intentionally, and again that I should tell her this stuff. She hasn't mentioned anything about me reading the messages, she hadn't been secretive about it or tried to hide them. I'm not going to try reading her stuff again but I just hope I won't think about it every time she gets a text. So I guess this stage is now seeing how we feel and talking a bit more about it all, and seeing how long the pain lasts. I feel if she becomes a bit secretive or confrontational about reading those messages it won't last much longer.

Summary of events: My first love and my best friend in the whole world started dating the end of sophomore year. We were always able to be very comfortable and dorky with each other and cared for each other very much. So she broke up with me because she isn't sure about what she wants right now so she doesn't want to be in a serious relationship right now and wants some Her time and she isn't sure if she loves me the same way as when we started dating. I am also leaving for college soon which she also addressed as a concern, but I am able to come home on any weekend I want. We both said how much we'd hate to lose each other as friends because of how close we are so we decided to still talk everyday and still hang out. I can trust her with anything and I know she would never intentionally hurt me. (even though she broke up with me, she felt it wasn't fair for me to be with someone who is all wishy washy on feelings). After some talking we agreed on being all access FWB or BFFWB (Bestfriend friends with benefits) and I am okay with this as she is really hot (sorry haha) and I love spending ""personal"" time with her and we always got along really well when it came to physical stuff. Issue: I still love her very very much and I know I will have difficulty working through all of this in my head. I just wanted to know if anyone had any advice for going about this without losing my sanity and my best friend. More Questions: Is it a bad idea to wait around for her? (I wouldn't put my life and other potential relationships on hold. I just mean is it bad to not let go of feelings I have for her or should I try to force them out) Has anyone else gone through something similar? What are some good ways to cope with sadness and other feelings?

I met this girl about 2 weeks ago at an SAT type test where I basically approached her and just introduced myself and had a nice conversation for around 20 minutes. We'll call her Ashley. It struck me by surprise but it turns out they she plays some of the online games that I play so we exchanged information and I said we should play sometime. It also turns out she lives pretty close to me. A couple days later I add her on Facebook and we had some small text conversations which led into me talking to her and her other friends and they seemed cool. We played every couple days and I don't want to sound cocky but I am much better at this game than Ashley and her friends. I can basically single-handedly win games and I have really improved Ashley's and her friends rating in game. She invites me to play a lot and gives small compliments here and there and her friends also seem to like me. Over the days I've developed a crush on her but it turned out that she had a boyfriend (also part of the friend group but doesn't play the game Ashley and I play) (damn that dude is ugly she can do better) which I did not particularly like but we have a lot in common and I wasn't about to let that ruin a potentially strong friendship. Now the part that I am very confused about. Yesterday, she asked me if I would go to a convention with just her (she even invited to go with her multiple days)(she cosplays). I said that I would have to see if I'm doing anything else on that day but I would most likely be able to go. Like, just me? She has a boyfriend and a bunch of other friends so why me? Don't get me wrong I'm not opposed to this in the slightest, I'm actually pretty excited. Any advice would appreciated because my judgement seems to be clouded.

(BG: He and I recently got back together after a couple rocky months, but have basically been together two years.) As expected, there were all sorts of people. He pointed out someone and went ""that's a dude, right?"" I tried to explain that the question wasn't really a polite one and said a few things about gender identity. Well, he decided that he was going to argue back about how sex and gender are biological and no matter how someone dresses that doesn't change. I was embarrassed and tried to quietly explain my thoughts and remind him of where we were. He proclaimed that they were his opinions and he wasn't being derogatory. I asked if we could leave. I felt so uncomfortable being there with him and really didn't want to be associated with his comments. He told me I was blowing it out of proportion. We left, but he was a bit of a jerk about it, reminding me that he only came to please me and said we should have stayed because his beliefs aren't harmful.

The guy she was texting was someone she used to date before we were together and stopped talking to when we started dating, but she happened to have a class with him at our college and regained connection. Anyways... At the bars tonight she dropped her phone on the way to the bathroom and I picked it up and it happened to be opened to her text messages. I saw the name of a guy she used to date about 3 threads down. Being the fuckwit I am I had to see what she was talking to him about. After I opened it I saw the guy saying something along the lines, ""you'd know something about blowjobs wouldn't you?"" She replied, ""what can I say. I aim to please ;). You know what I mean though. "" Also she said ""most of the time the best part of going to class is just seeing you.""

Me and my SO have been having intimacy issues for the past year or so, I've come to the conclusion that this is because of me using porn to get off all the time and that I have self image issues when in bed with her.

This has been spiraling downwards and we haven't had sex for at least three months and my self image is so bad that I've been diagnosed for depression and I'm taking anti-depression medicine, have also been diagnosed with aspergers which may explain some of my habits concerning this issue.

SO me and my gf have been going out for the past year. being young and stupid I didn't think of going to uni and what would happen then because I had known this girl for about 7 years and pretty much always liked her for all that time. It never happened for us, one way or another, but we have always been really close. We started casually but then we both fell in love pretty damn hard. For this entire summer we have basically lived together and I can really see her becoming more than a girlfriend one day. She is just the perfect girl for me. The problem is us both getting our first choice at uni and now we will be seperated by about 200 miles. I always wanted to go to uni single because I didn't want to miss any opportunities through being in a relationship. Me and my gf talk about this all the time as it's the elephant in the room that we cant just ignore. We have decided to try the long distance thing but she is a very dependent person and I dont think she will be able to hack being away for months at a time. I think everything would be better if we split up now but I don't know what to do. I love this girl more than anything in the world but we would only get to see each other in the holidays because on a student salary without a car I cant afford to get trains up and down the country every other weekend. I feel like I have ruined her uni experience no matter what. We break up now and she is devastated at losing what we have or we stay together and eventually our relationship breaks apart because I'll get to see her once every few months :/. Generally I would just love any help and advice from people who have been through this. Thank you.

A couple of weeks ago, I was set up on a blind date by a friend. I hadn't ever been on a date before, so I thought why not. The date seemed to go okay. We have the same humor and I thought he was really nice. However, he's described himself as really romantic (which I'm not) and comes off a little too strong. When we're together, he's always touching me and cuddling and it makes me uncomfortable. I've told him I'm not really a touchy-feely type, but it hasn't changed much. Plus he keeps constantly complimenting me and jokingly mentioning marriage and our future. I'm not looking for anything long term (we're in high school for goodness' sake) and I'm not sure what to do. We just met a month ago and started dating last week. Is it moving too fast or is this just what relationships are like? I'm new to the whole dating seen, am I overreacting?

So my ex (28M) and i (27F) broke up 3 months ago (1 year relationship). He lied to me. I discovered we was seeing someone else. He is still lying to me. Saying he is not in a relationship, pretending he cares about me and wants me back, he even have a Christmas gift for me and wants to see me. I replied that we broke up and shouldn't give gifts to each other and the only gift i want is the money he owes me. Also wants to see me because he wants to go back home close to his family (i was ok but in 2 years) and wanted to talk to me in person about that during a dinner. He said he spent few days out of town to visit a friend and was alone for Christmas because he had to travel for work. I know who is the girl and i've checked on facebook. He is not at all travelling for work but spending holidays with her family and there is some couple pictures of them. If i was the girlfriend i would like to know what my boyfriend is doing behind my back. I don't want him back. I just want he leaves me alone. For now, i am nice with him because he owes me money. He is supposed to give me the last payment this week. So after he paid me, should i tell him i know he is lying? And/her his gf too?

I [F20] have been good friends with this guy [M19] for about 2 years - I met him when I first started university. After we had been friends for a few months he started wanting to spend more time together - study alone and stuff. I suspected that he had a crush on me. I tried to give him signs that I just wanted to be friends but eventually he asked me out. I told him that I didn't feel the same way. We decided to stay friends. Since I rejected him, he hasn't brought it up at all, but everyone knows that he still likes me. I think his friends poke fun at him for it. Over time, I've gotten to know him better and he's amazing. I'm just not physically attracted to him. It's not that he's hideous or anything, I'm just not attracted to him. He's always there if I need him, he buys me awesome birthday presents, helps me study, cooks for me. Last night I was really sick and I ended up getting rushed to the hospital to have an appendectomy. I texted my parents, and a couple of other people before I went in, in case something happened. I woke up at about 3AM this morning after having the surgery and he was asleep in the chair next to me. I feel so bad because I know he would be a great boyfriend, I just can't imagine being with someone I'm not attracted to. Can it possibly work?

Me and 'Ben' met a month ago and hit it off straight away. We're currently on an island and he works at the only bar so I see him pretty often. We came to an easy mutual understanding that we would essentially be fuck buddies. Anyway, so here's the problem - when we are physically together we get along great, he's very talkative, we'll hang out when he gets off work and the sex is very good, but when I send him a message asking if he's free or whatever he'll take ages to respond, if at all, and when he does it's often way past when I'm asleep. This would be understandable if he just wanted sex and I didn't (ie. he thought I wanted a relationship) and thought I was being clingy or whatever, but we're both after the same thing - no strings attached sex. It's just a bit annoying when I'd be more than happy to come up to his but he doesn't tell me he's free/there until some ungodly hour but when I actually see him he's his friendly self again. Is he just crappy with messaging or does he only want to have sex when he happens to be back in his bed? I know in a way we're just using each other, but at the same time I am starting to feel a little used. Any advice would really help, maybe I'm just not seeing something.

I lived about a mile away from my boyfriend (we've been dating for 10 months), and it was really convienent! He came over nearly every day after work. Unfortunately, where I was living was an awful envirnonment. I don't want to get into details but basically we could never leave my bedroom (and he still loved me throughout the entire stay! What a saint). Of course we did a lot of things outside of the house, but I was really longing for a comfortable place to live. Even outside of the relationship. I guess what I'm trying to say is that even though we spent a lot of time together where I used to live, it was stressful and not relaxing and we were both uncomfortable. I wouldn't call it quality time. Anyway. I busted my butt (I'm in college, even!) to be able to afford an apartment on my own. And just last month I found a lovely apartment 30 minutes away from my boyfriend. Lots of space, comfortable, kitchen, living room, even a fireplace! I mean, it's great. I actually feel like I have a home. Since moving... Seeing my boyfriend has been less than frequent. I know I shouldn't be upset. He's tight on money, works 40 hour weeks, has friends and family besides me. I want him to spend time with himself and his other friends but I just get a little sad and lonely. What should I do about that? He tells me all the time he loves me. Sends me texts throughout the day. I see him most of the time on the weekend. Some times he comes over after work and spends the night and gets up early and does the 30 minute drive to work. A part of me gets huffy because if someone really wanted to see you, they wouldn't mind the drive, right? I'm probably being selfish. I hope I'm conveying my situation in the right light. I would like some suggestions as to what I should do to keep myself from feeling lonely? I'm really happy where I am and under no circumstances will move back to where I was. I just miss my boyfriend since he is a big part of my life. Thank you!

Hi everyone. My SO and I live together and have been together about a year. We have a great relationship, we're both very open people and I think generally we communicate very well. We do row occasionally like many couple do but we appear to have very different ""argument styles"", which I think is due to personality differences. For example, personality tests I have done before conclude that I am very much a ""detail"" thinker and struggle with ""big picture"" ideas (I'm a software developer). When we have fallen out, we do make friends very quickly. We sit down and talk and listen but the difference is I'm very much in camp ""Let's really, really talk this to death to get to the ""core"" of the problem (even though the row is usually stemmed from something minor, but I am an emotional person) and he is in camp ""We've talked, let's just stop this and do fun stuff because then we can get on with being happy"" I know this is vague but it's because it doesn't apply to something that had happened recently, but more as an observation in my relationship. Hive mind, what do you think is the most ""healthy"" approach?

I'm 21, she's about 21 as well, we met during dancing lessons six weeks ago. I get along quite well with this lady. In particular, we can talk without any end or inhibition, understand each other's sense of humour, etc. Of course, she's taken, but given that I have no female best friend she would be perfect to fill that position. The thing is, whenever we're together the tension and, quite frankly, arousal from having her by my side can become very distracting. My rationality is inhibited by her presence and I start imagining that she fancies me, so coming down to the realisation she doesn't after we part leaves me melancholic for the rest of the day. Is there a way out of my misery? If I were to try explaining my reaction, I would say that it's simply because of the time we spend together and the attention she pays to me. (I've never had an actual romantic relationship, even though I once spent half a year flirting before she told me about her boyfriend.) I've had several similar episodes in the past, none of which ended favourably (with either a romantic relationship or a friendship). Key events in those episodes were sharing an umbrella, receiving dancing lessons, talking about lightning, discussing her art and receiving a hug in return. One time when it's gone well, I believe the reason it worked was because I got to really know her only after having met and befriended her boyfriend. He's my best friend now. In the case currently at hand, this possible solution is sadly not feasible.

We have similar pasts (self harm/depression) and we can relate to each other very well. However, Madison is being extremely flirty with me - making sex jokes including the two of us, looking for opportunities to touch me, and initiating poke wars (common flirting thing at my high school). She is making it obvious she wants my number but I'm afraid to give it. I'm afraid because her boyfriend is a sophomore football player, and I'm imagining would not be too happy about her flirting with me. How do I deal with this situation?

So my brother (20/M) is currently in his first relationship(also 20/M). They've been together for a few months and have had problems from the get-go. My father is muslim and homophobic, the bfs father is homophobic as well. It started when my brother's bf's father found out. He flipped out and started calling my dad. We were planning on keeping everything quiet unless it turned out to be serious and long term. That went out the window. The father started emailing printscreens of private Facebook conversations to my dad. Apparently he had access to bfs computer. I deleted them to give my brother time to talk to my dad about it himself. My dad had been calling his father a liar for the time all this was happening. After my brother came clean, one last conversation was had with the father. My dad told him to stop calling and the father had a breakdown and started crying. Several months later, after some suspicious behavior from the bf (refusing to get tested for STDs in case the father found out, despite free anonymous testing being available in every fucking city) I get a call from my brother saying bf said that his father is planning on cutting off financial support and is threatening to ""attack"" my family. I don't know if he means legally or physically. I'm angry, and don't know what to do. I'm the only person in a position to help my brother out right now. Other info: we are American, in different universities in the Netherlands. My brother lives 3 hours away from me. Bfs parents live in Luxembourg.

A little background story... Back in the day (19ish) I used to be a big poon hound, I mean I would get laid all the time by girls that were probably a step above me. Eventually I got in some long term relationships, but was never a month without someone else to have companionship. Fast forward to today, I have been 6 months single, heart-broken by I must say the girl of my dreams (beauty queen, cool family, engineering student, freak in bed). While I have moved past this, I have also been pretty upset I haven't really gotten anyone new lately, I mean my usual is to upgrade but I fear I might have reached the top on this one. I am graduating college this year and already am hired as a software engineer (70k+), I am fairly attractive, fit (long distance running, weight lifting), charismatic, and generally have a blast all the time. BUT it seems like after a first date with an attractive, smart, girl...the relationship kinda fizzles out. I can't even get one night stands like I used to when I was a freshman and sophmore, and when I do, they are sub-par I must say. My question is, do women get harder to attract at an older age? (19yr olds vs 21-24yr olds) or have I just lost my touch? I am not out to get laid here I just am getting frustrating finding someone to share my life with, I just don't get what women want I am not ugly, in shape, intelligent, funny, and successful. Like seriously can you guys spot something I am doing wrong?

So a little back story, I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year now. We'll call him Stan. He has a five year old son from a previous relationship and was very upfront about that from the start and I'm obviously fine with it. Things did not end well with his ex (which is a whole other screwed up story) and she has made it her goal to make sure he has no place in his child's life. This woman is pretty crazy and I'm not just saying that because she's my boyfriends ex. She had a decent sized criminal record before he got involved with her and she is only adding to it currently. She was able to take the child out of state because she had a restraining order placed on Stan claiming that he had hit her. Truth was she gave herself several bruises and had family lie for her to support her claims. There is a long list of other things this woman has done but we won't go there. Stan has made every attempt to reach out to his son from trying to send letters to sending gifts for birthdays and even offering to give her family money to support the child. There's a long custody battle going on right now and it will still be a while before he is able to see his kid. It breaks his heart that he can't be there for his son and it upsets me to see him hurt. My question is, how do I handle father's day? We are spending time with both sides of the family that day but I am unsure if I should mention something specifically to him. I know for sure that it wouldn't be right to get him some cliche gift. I have thought about just writing a small note that says how I'm sure he'll make a great father for his son and I'm sure things will work out soon. Or I could skip that and just treat him a little extra nice that day and not bring anything up. Anyone else out there that have been in similar situations?

We live about an hour away from her parents. She REALLY loves spending time with her family. (My family is pretty chill about not getting together too often, plus my family is a little older with kids of their own). So far this summer, we have spent almost every weekend and holiday with her family, including a full week in June. The 4th of July we were together. Just... we are ALWAYS together. She now wants to go 3 hours away to be with another relative + her family for the weekend. We both work full-time. We have also been battling moving in to our new place we got in May. So free time is precious. And we have stuff to do this weekend. I feel like we need some alone time. I feel like cultivating your own family is extremely important. And a lot of that requires living together without your family every spare moment you get. **Two Questions:** 1. Am I too anal about how much time we spend with the in-laws? 2. How can I approach this in the best way possible? P.S. She's SUPER sensitive.

Hi folks, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but I'm looking for some dating advice for a soon-to-be widow. I'm hoping to get answers from people who have been around the dating block a bit. Ok, here I go. So, I probably won't be around for very long. That's a whole other story that I don't want to get into right now. I'm taking all of the necessary steps to set up my wife after I'm gone: financial transfers, life insurance claims, etc... However, there is one part that I'm really worried about: finding emotional support for my wife and, related to that, finding a new guy in her life. The reason why I'm so worried about this is because my wife and I are very much in love with each other, and we are each others best friends. She has little to no emotional support besides her parents, and hardly any friends nearby in which she can lean on. In fact, she hardly has any friends she still keeps in touch with. Most of them dropped contact after she moved far away from her small town. And, we've both learned over the past several years that making new friends is really hard, and mostly, the only true friends you have are your significant others, and family. She cries so hard at times that I worry after I die, she will also die from a broken heart. It really breaks my heart seeing her like that. I think that the best way for her to overcome the depression, grief, and inevitable loneliness is to find a new guy and start a whole new chapter in her life. But, there's the rub: how does she find the ""right"" guy. The one? I'm sure there is no formula, but I think there must be some good advice to weed out the weirdos, flakes, assholes, and players. I mean, we've lived in California for over several years, and we've met so much weird, flaky people that I get worried about her staying and dating here. Any advice?

So my boy and I have been together for about three months officially, but we were seeing each other fairly exclusively for about two months before that and we've been friends for right around a year. I know him well and pretty much adore the guy. He doesn't smoke every day, usually it is more like once or twice a week, but when he does he gets exceptionally stoned. I smoke with him occasionally, probably close to once or twice a month. I don't have a problem with marijuana at all, but I've never been the chill out and smoke a bowl type, I'm too energetic and type A for that to really sound appealing very often. Anyhow, normally he is a pretty affectionate guy, but when he is stoned he isn't very touchy and doesn't respond to my touch as much. In the beginning of our relationship it really worried me, because I didn't realize the correlation and thought that my new awesome boyfriend was losing interest in me. Also, he gets pretty unresponsive in conversation. The other night we had been talking about a problem I had over text, he invited me over to talk about it with him/comfort me later that night. When I showed up he had been smoking, and that made it much harder to get feedback from him like I wanted. I don't want him to stop, he enjoys it and it is a fairly important thing to him and his friends. Mostly I would just like some kind of heads up if he has been smoking, and maybe to let him know that there are times I'd rather he not smoke (like if he knows I am coming over to talk about a problem with him)

She had just transferred to a different school about an hour away and two days after she moved in she told me that she didn't know what she wanted anymore and that she wanted the ""true college experience"". She says she still cares about me and that shes not sure if she wants it to be over but it feels like she already made up her mind.

She receives the flirting generally well, and returns it to me as well. Fast forward a few days and we go out for a bit, and end up staying out super late and hanging out. Plot twist, she has a boyfriend but makes it a *very clear point* to tell me that they're going to break up very soon. We keep hanging out and talking and setting up future days to hang out, but now she doesn't really text back. She's bad at texting, basically, and I'm not sure the implications.

She gets home extremely late and never wants to do anything. I try to be sweet by helping her out and make her dinner. Anyways, it seems like she isn't interested anymore with me. Anytime i try to be intimate with her, she says I'm being pushy, which really I'm not trying to be. Then other nights she teases me like she is interested and we go to bed, but then its like a switch and she is more interested in sleep. I know i should talk to her, which I plan to tonight, just stressed out on what could have changed...

In the start of the relationship, there was an instant and amazing connection. We shared some emotionally intimate moments that went far beyond any of our experiences before. Despite having been in multiple long term relationships myself before this one. But Now, As I get closer to graduating I am finding myself feeling uninterested and unmotivated to spend time with her, or put the energy in to make the connections that we used too. She went through a lot of issues in the last year with school, and It certainly caused some trouble between us, but I stuck with her and helped her through everything, even her own depression. It was great and she swears by my support and affection. (although it did take a fair amount out of me at times) But here I am facing the rest of my life, Super excited and confident in it. However, I find that anytime I am not putting in time and effort towards my career, or hanging out with my friends, I get really down and depressed. If I am just alone for an evening, or if I am spending a day with My Gf. I just start feeling really bland and uninterested in anything. And Just looking forward to the time I can work again or see all my friends again. I don't play videogames, I don't really want to have sex (as often), and I feel like I'm not happy with myself. this is becoming a huge issue in our relationship, And It seems really silly to me, but I am really questioning if I have feelings for her any more. Is it possible that I am depressed and it makes me feel this way? Or is it coming from an actual loss of the spark that brought us together? The only part that makes this really hard for me is that I don't feel depressed when I am with people doing stuff, and working on things. So it seems weird to be depressed just some of the time. Also I find myself thinking about other girls a lot, even if I know they aren't really compatible with me, I just fantasize about someone who can make me feel motivated even in the times when I would start to feel down.

First time posting here, and I need a some suggestions about where to go on a first date from the hive. Normally, I wouldn't think twice about it, and I'd go with drinks & dinner, or coffee, or some other standard first date fair. However, I think this situation is a little different. We're both in our early 30's. A friend of my parents knows her and, out of the blue, suggested to her that we get together. This gets relayed to me through my parents a few weeks ago, and I gave her a call earlier this week. What I expected to be a 10 minute conversation turned into nearly an hour and a half of talking. We've exchanged a few texts the last few days, and I feel as though we kind of hit it off on the phone. We're supposed to see each other on Sunday afternoon, and I am struggling on coming up with what to do. Since we learned so much about each other on the phone, I think Sunday will be somewhere between a 1st date and a 2nd date. So, coffee is out. Could do a late lunch, but I'd rather do something that's less run-of-the-mill. I'm actually contemplating an easy day hike, but I'm not very familiar trails near her. (She actually lives a few hours away, near my parents, whom I'm visiting this weekend.) So, what sayeth you? Anyone have any suggestions?

My boyfriend(m22) is terrible at planning ahead. Terrible. We started dating when we were 16, we've been relatively happy for the whole time. We've survived college (mostly) and will both be graduating next Spring. We've never had to dealt with a huge change in our relationship. We go to college in the same city (but we don't go to the same school.) We have our own friends, interests, and jobs. But we hang out a lot and we love each other. He's terrible at thinking ahead. I am constantly looking ahead. We've only briefly talked about what happens to us after graduation. We've never lived together (in a permanent way) and we kinda beat around the bush that he'd move into my apartment after he graduates because I still have 3 months on my lease and he lives in the dorms. Tonight, we were talking and basically said he wasn't going to move in with me after all. When I asked him where he was going to move, he said it depended on where he found a job. ... He makes me feel like I'm being a needy girl, or somehow I'm being impatient when I want to know the future of our relationship. I don't want a ring, I don't want any of that yet, but I do want to know I'm not wasting my time down a dead-end. I want to know what his intentions are, but every time I try to be to the point about it, he changes the subject or beats around the bush. I just want a fucking answer and he makes it seem like that topic is ""so far away"" and that he doesn't know yet. What the hell do I do?

Ok so backstory, I met this girl a little over a year ago in a class at school, and we immediately hit it off, we got along really well and I would've loved to have a relationship with her. We talked about going out all the time, we both knew we liked one another, but at the time she wasn't interested in starting anything and wanted to remain friends. Obviously i was disappointed but we continued to be friends. That semester (Fall 2013) ends and we don't talk nearly as much mabye see eachother like once a month or two. So now this new semester has started and we have a class together, everything started to come to the surface, but i was still under the intentions that she didn't want anything with me. About a week ago she was texting me asking to come over, to have sex and starts to back out of it. I thought the reason for this was because if we did have sex, she thought it would be like what it was before with me wanting a relationship and her not interested. So i tell her im not interested in a relationship and she then tells me that she did have feelings for me but not anymore, and she isn't interested in anything to do with me now, because i said that. I really do care about this girl and nothing would make me happy then to go out with her, but what do i do in this situation? and was i wrong for thinking the way i did? any advice?

We met online a couple months ago, chatted for awhile and decided to meet about a month ago. We hit it off pretty well the first date, we went for coffee and when the shop closed we went for a couple beers. Conversation was flawless, at the end we hugged and agreed to meet again. About a week later (on a week day) we had our second ""date"" at his place; it was a movie night. We cuddled and watched 2 movies, again got along quite well. When I left he didn't go for a kiss, we hugged again and brought up the idea of going out again on the weekend. We texted the next day, agreeing that Saturday night would be a good time, on Friday however he said he was sick and probably wouldn't be up for getting together this weekend. I went out with another friend instead and sent him a pic of us out and he said ""that's awesome, I'm sick as hell"" and I said ""feel better soon"". I didn't hear from him the next day and asked how he was feeling, again, no reply. 3 days with no contact I asked him how his week was going, he said ""Working too much"" to which I said, ""That's no fun! Are you at least feeling better?"". That's it. It's been about 6 hours since the last text. Even writing this out I feel like, it should be obvious, he just isn't that into me... but when we were together it seemed to go so well. He does have his own business, which I am *sure* can be very hectic. Why would he ask for a second date, at his home, if he wasn't interested? What I am having a really hard time with is what to say now. I don't want to seem desperate, I don't want to pester him, but I also don't want to go belly up and relinquish the chance for this to go further. What can I possibly say?

I know the title sounds weird, so let me explain. I am 20 years old and male. I am going to college right now. I am a kissless virgin, but I don't really mind. My friends on the other hand, I guess they mind. They have basically created a game centering around the idea of me getting a girlfriend/having sex. They have even started a money pool, where whoever I guess manages to get me to talk to a girl/have sex with one will win the cash prize. Allegedly they are putting in $80 into this money pool. They pester me a decent amount from day to day, asking me why I don't go talk to X girl, or why I didn't ask out X girl, etc. For a short while I tried playing along, but soon I realized I basically have to many mental hangups regarding women/I guess people and am not really capable of having a relationship with anyone. I didn't want to outright say this to my friends because I don't want to sound weird/crazy, so I just told them that I don't want to take part anymore. However, they keep pestering me about this. Almost constantly wherever we go somewhere they basically keep telling me to try and talk to a girl, or they tell me to ask a girl out, and it is bothering me. They are making me feel like a failure for not having ever kissed a girl despite the fact that internally I don't really mind not having done so. It is also de-humanizing to me because I feel like they have basically created a game using my feelings and sort of just kick them around. I have tried asking them to stop, but they will not listen. I do not want to have to admit the real reasons why I cant get a relationship, but I am not sure what else I can do. Even if I did admit why, I do not think they would still stop. They would probably just tell me to get over it or just continue doing what they are doing...

Throwaway because it's 2014 and everyone in the world uses reddit. So my wedding is coming up towards the end of December. My sister, Jessica (27F), is a bridesmaid and her boyfriend, John (29M), is one of my groomsmen. We have a small wedding party, too. They've been together for about 5 years. I (29M) like John, but he was a groomsman pretty much on the assumption that he would be part of our family for the rest of forever. Now, a few weeks out, she's breaking up with him. I don't imagine I will have much of a serious relationship with him now that they're over. I don't know too many details about the situation, but Jess said doesn't ideally want him to be standing up there with all of us. I don't blame her, I mean these will be the photographs and memories we have for the rest of our lives. So I guess now I have to ""break up"" with John as well. I plan on still inviting him to the wedding if he's comfortable being there, just not in the wedding party. Any advice on how to go about doing this? I really don't want this to be like I'm kicking him while he's down., but I can't see any way around it. Any advice on how to ask another buddy of mine to be a groomsman without making it seems like a consolation prize?

Well, me (18 years old) and my girlfriend (17) have been together for about a year now and i still love her to death. Anyways, let's proceed to the subject. She has told me about the guys she's been with before we got together. And i've heard stories that made me angry and sad, i mean she's been treated really bad by these douchebags that it made me feel that i had to do confront these bastards. Okay here's one of the persons. I know who the guy is and i've seen him a couple of times, he slept with my girlfriend on four occasions (before our relationship of course) and it was mostly just sex, no emotions whatsoever, except a couple of times, but in general just sex. She told me that he was acting like a real douche infront of his friends when she was present, but when they were alone he was mostly adorable. Things he did, was mostly hit her on the arm, push here etc. And once he made her suck his dick(well forced here a bit, he kept saying that he wanted a bj, and she was afraid of him so she did it). So as you guys can see, he was a total jerk. Now there were more occasions with other people, such as one guy that hit her beaver with his foot etc. (know this guy too). Now i feel really bad about this, i mean the feelings came now, a year after. I've been thinking about this but not very much, and i still don't know what to do.... I'm angry and sad, i just want to hit these guys, and i haven't done it yet, and i really don't have a lot of experience from fighting (except for training Muay thai 3 months, and a street fight against two people, but more than that no). I just really feel like a complete coward doing nothing about this. So please, the people of reddit, give me some advice tell me what i should do.

From the beginning he told me who his ideal woman was, definitely not me. Here we are after being together for a while and I am still not his ideal, I'm changing my life situation, my bad traits and now my looks to try to please him but I have a horrible feeling that I will never be good enough. He told me flat out today he likes: Blonde hair Dark eye makeup/Pink Lips Pale Skin Flat Stomach Any size Boobs Thigh Gap I am Brunette (currently dying my hair blonde for him) Dark eye makeup Unearthly Pale, like Laptop tan kind of pale Pudgy as fuck, I'm a gamer. I like to sit in and play games and eat pizza. fucking sue me. and my boobs are ok He basically is saying Jessica Nigri is his ideal woman and I am, I suppose, in his league. Which kind of makes me feel like I've been settled for a little bit. So I am moving the heavens and the earth to change my appearance, albeit not exactly how I am comfortable, for him but I feel like it is all in vain. Honestly I'm breaking my back to make myself half of the woman this cosplayer is and I'm worried I'll go through all of the trauma (Kind of beat myself up about being chubby a lot since high school) to look like her and then find out I'm not as hot. Feel free to say I'm being a little bitch, I'm just upset.

I'm not sure if I'm in the right place or not. But this is my first attempt to try get any tips or help on this issue I have. Basically i met this girl online about one and a half year ago and I fell in love with her and eventually she got a crush on me too (after a while). Time goes on and this is my first ever time really having some kind of deep bond/connection with a girl. I didn't realize until I met her how jealous I can get. One time she didn't skype with me and I saw her online on skype, and I actually started crying. That's how jealous I got and how crushed it made me feel. But things were nice and me and her talked everyday and we also met in real life, kissed and all that stuff. But eventually the guy she was always in love with deep down, comes back (her ex). This guy, she also only knows on the internet. So I get crushed and to this day after 6 months they seem to be doing fine together. So lets get to the problem. Everytime I would see her online on skype or just on any other kind of social media. I'd just get so sad cause I know she doesn't talk to me and some other guy and that jealousy makes me insane. But I can't stop looking until she's offline, that is the only time I can find peace and relax. I constantly have my phone with whatsapp and skype open to see if she is talking to somebody and when she will quit. Its making my days so unproductive cause it makes me sad when I see her online. It feels like I'm just harming myself but the feeling of not knowing if she's talking to somebody or not is really frustrating to me. And eventually I will look to see if she's connected/online or not. This has been going on for almost a year soon. This might be really weird, I haven't really found anyone with the same issue, however I'm sure there are some. Anyways if you guys have some tips, I would appreciate it.

Link to op : I met him today for lunch. He looked happy to see me and I was happy to see his handsome face too. I noticed he talk too much too fast though which I don't like. He did get me a sandwich and Starbucks though. Anyway, we talked about us and he said he was not ready for a ""full blown relationship"" because he did not want time / he saw it consumed his friends' lives. I mean I don't want one right away but this made me a bit wary. He did say he was attracted to me, could talk freely with me, wanted to keep seeing me, and we could be exclusive if I wanted. Not sure if I want that since exclusive dating, is, eh? I would commit to a relationship but just dating with no real assurance of more? Anyway, I understand, he is an RA and a CS and economics double major. We go to a top school so studying all the time is a must. He texted me later saying he had a good time. I asked him if he wanted to spend more one on one time with me tonight, and he said yes. So I am excited about that. I don't want a relationship right away either, esp. since I will graduate in 2-3 months. What do you all think? Can this work? Should it? I have a few people I saw here and there but no one I have liked as much as him.

My wife and I have been married for just over one year. She works full time in education while I complete my second year of MBA school. She is basically the sole breadwinner of our family and has been incredibly supportive of my graduate school aspirations. However, I observed back when we were first dating that the majority of our problems originated with alcohol. So we both cut back and are rarely ever drunk together. In fact, I almost never have more than 2 beers or glasses of wine (and never liquor) in any setting. My wife cut back her casual drinking over the past few years and now she either drinks an extremely small amount (one drink or less) or gets absolutely shitfaced. She usually gets ""blackout drunk"" (her term, not mine) every 1.5 - 2 weeks. These nights she will stay out at the bar until 2AM or later, while I am either annoyed at her antics or just at home asleep. This has caused some issues for us: my wife thinks that I'm judging her when she's having fun and drinking with her friends, while I'm often embarrassed by her words and actions. So what's reddit's opinion? Am I an uptight destroyer-of-fun because I don't like to get drunk and crazy? Or should she be as embarrassed of her actions as I am? Most importantly, should I confront her about her drinking? Does it sound like she's at risk of alcohol abuse?

We're in long distance relationship and usually see each others every other weekend. We used to date few years back when we lived in same city until I had to move away to study. Half a year ago we got back to talking and decided to try out if we could get this long distance thing to work. Anyways few weeks back on Friday evening we were chatting on Skype when she got phone call. She muted Skype as she usually does when answering phone calls, I've never really paid too much attention to that. She told me it was her brother who was coming to visit the city and told she would be gone for the night. This morning I decided to log my Facebook which has been deactivated for past 3 years. Browsed people I used to hang out with in high school, who had baby and who was studying to be doctor. Then I checked my SO's profile page and saw there picture of her and her ex from that night she said she'd be with her brother. Okay could be they just bumped into each others so why not just ask how the night went from her.. so she came online to Skype few hours later and we small talked all this daily stuff. Then I asked her how was her night with her brother earlier and she said they just went to movies and straight to her parents place from there.. I asked if they visit any nightclubs or saw anyone else. She just said no and I brought up the picture. She immediately told that I have no reason to stalk her and follow her goings (wtf?). I said I'm just curious but she decided to change subject and shortly after logged off. So now I'm here sitting and thinking the worst which for me feels the most obvious. What to do? Should I call her or wait her to come clean? I really have no idea how to handle this now.

19 F here, dating 22 M. We met online 9 or so months ago, and it took a few months of almost constant communication before we actually met in real life and started dating each other, long distance. It didn't take me long before I realized there was some sort of emotional block between us, stopping us from really discussing real life issues, or talking about ourselves and our problems. I have chronic depression, which caused me to drop out of school and has turned me to staying inside my house and on the computer all the time. I haven't really left the house in a few months, aside from building up the courage to go visit him for a weekend every now and then. He's completely aware of my situation, but doesn't really say much about it, so I don't either. I'd say our long-distance relationship is somewhat of a weird friendship, more than anything else. We don't talk about our feelings. The past few times I've broken down (anxiety attack) in front of him, he becomes exasperated with me, sighs constantly, keeps nudging at me, and gets angry when I can't hold it together. It took me awhile to realize that I might be holding onto him for the sole purpose that in this really dark patch, he makes me feel normal. Simply waking up and knowing that I have a boyfriend lightens the guilt I have about not leaving the house, losing my diploma, losing all connections with the outside world, and wanting to die. I feel horrible for this. I feel like the only thing keeping this together is the severe hope that I will change, he will be closer to me emotionally, I will be happy, I will not be completely alone. I feel attached, but I'm scared. Please, anyone, I would appreciate any advice at all. If you took the time to read this, thank you so much.

Not sure where to start here. I've been with my GF for 10 years and we have lived together for 5. Same story...first few years were great and now not so much. We have good times and bad and this past week we went on a vacation to New Orleans. We (or I) had a blast until the very last night of the vacation when we got into a drunken fight and said somethings we shouldn't have. Went to bed on the couch and woke up to take the long plane ride home. Once we got home, I was told that the fight we had ruined the entire vacation for her and that it was the fight that made her realize that she doesn't love me anymore. This devastated me. We have stupid fights here and there and I didn't think this was a big deal. She told me that when she saves up enough money she is moving out and that she wants me to leave her alone until then. Naturally I responded by telling her that one fight should not define the entire vacation or our relationship, but she said she was looking at this trip as a time to rekindle things and the fight just ruined everything for her. I'm writing this post because I really have no idea what to do. I love her with all my heart and we were talking about getting married after I graduated from school in the spring. I feel terrible for the stupid fight and I can't think straight about anything else. I honestly feel like the past 10 years of my life has just been wasted and its all my fault. Is there anything I can do to make things right? How can a relationship of 10 years be ended over a single stupid drunk fight? She doesn't even want me to talk to her. We live in a small apartment and I can't avoid her and all I want to do is set things straight. I love her with all my heart and soul and I don't know what to do.

I'm 21/F and have been with my boyfriend, 24, for a year and a half now. 2 months ago he left me, he slept with another girl within the month we were apart. We're working through that part fine. The only thing that seems to be getting worse is my jealousy. I never had an issue with it before as I had no reason to feel threatened, he seemed to want to be with me and I trusted him but after him leaving out the blue I can't seem to let myself fall into a sense of security. I now find it difficult to watch films or shows with actresses I know he finds attractive, whenever an attractive girl walks down the street I find myself staring at him to see if he's looking at her, if we come across a good looking girls photo on imgur or reddit I skip past it really quickly as I don't want him to see it. It is ridiculous! I know how crazy I'm behaving and I haven't stopped him from doing anything because of my jealousy as I know it's totally irrational but it's eating me up inside. I can't stop thinking that he's comparing me to every other good looking, funny, intelligent or quirky girl out there. I haven't been able to get naked in front of him for nearly 3 months which then makes me even more paranoid as whenever I see a confident girl I think he wishes he could be with her. I then act like a TOTAL bitch and point out the girls flaws to put him off which is ridiculous, if I don't want him to judge my imperfections I should stop doing it to other girls. I'm worried that I'm going to start taking it out on him, I find myself making comments about him looking at other girls and I don't want to be one of those people. I constantly look twice if I see a good looking guy, there's no harm in it, so why shouldn't he be able to. Today I saw a photo of an old friend from my school, she's just had a boob job and looks amazing and I became so jealous that I started to get moody....what the hell! I just don't know how to stop.

My bf and I have been together about a year and a half, and I spent most of that time being head-over-heels in love with him. I saw myself marrying him, thought we were oh-so perfect, etc. I was fortunate enough to witness a truly beautiful love story involving his dad and step-mom, who just passed away last week. Like it was the stuff they make movies about. But it all got me feeling like maybe I don't have that kind of love with my bf, and I've caught myself wondering if there's someone out there who would just love me in a different way. We don't really have any problems in our relationship, but he's not romantic and I just don't feel any spark. I know he loves me but I don't get that feeling like his world would be over if we broke up or anything. I don't even know if what I'm feeling is a legitimate thing, or if I'm just looking for shit to complain about. He's a great guy, no questions about that. We have fun and we have a lot in common, but sometimes it's almost like a friends with benefits thing in some aspects. I just don't know if he can give me that ""fairy-tale love"" I sometimes want. But maybe that's just too rare of a thing and I should just appreciate what I have.

My boyfriend makes more than double what I do, and therefore pays for most of what we do. At first, I tried to make sure we alternate paying for things, but he now knows what I make so I think he feels bad. He was raised a gentleman so he ALWAYS tries to pay for me when we go out. I usually make it a point to ask to either split it or pay for the whole thing, but I feel like he spends way more than I do. I always thank him and try to make sure he knows how much I appreciate it. I don't think he even thinks twice about paying. I don't want to feel like I'm keeping score of how much we both spend because I don't believe relationships should be like that, but I feel terrible when we go do something and I know I don't have the money for it. What are some free or cheap things I can do to show him how much I appreciate him? And then what are some big things I can save up for to surprise him and show my appreciation?

I am a junior this year, soon a senior. To cut it short, this girl likes me and never leaves me alone. In person she's bearable, but online is where she is terrible. We see each other in the mornings and in the halls, but we share no classes. She will message me daily when school lets out and whether I answer or not, will talk. When I do answer, it is in short curt messages. When she responds, it is in lengthy, annoyingly adult paragraphs. I have confronted her before about the attachment she displays. She does like me, which is made worse by the fact that I have a girlfriend and 15F knows this. I have told her friends to ask her to back off a little, but this is a temporary solution. Our school has a two week class-free exam period for seniors and juniors, so for that I blocked her. And for spring break. When I got back both times, she was curt to me, but was still her talkative self. Her friends relayed to me that she was a little annoyed with me for that. Honestly, I am at my wit's end with her.

To some this might seem stupid, but to myself and my girlfriend marriage is a very important furthering of our relationship. Both coming from Christian backgrounds we strongly believe in not moving in together beforehand and all the things that go with that. Our relationship has definitely reached a point where marriage is a 'when' rather than an 'if'. We met in college, but we will be each moving into individual share houses with other friends next year, so from that perspective our relationship is potentially going backwards, going from more or less living together seeing each other basically every day to what will be probably only 2 or 3 times a week if we're lucky. The dilemma we have is that before she met me she had decided to that she would not marry until after her degree was completed (another 4 years away). Ideally with our relationship it would make sense to be married in the next 12-24months. So my opinion is marriage is say something like the summer of 2016/17 (Australia here), but by my gf it would not work until 2019 at really the earliest. Due to this issue she in fact thought I was going to break up with her the other night, but I no, I love her enough to wait 4 years if I need to. Of course I think that 4 years will be an unnecessary difficultly on our relationship. I don't want to put pressure on her because, well, I love her and want what is best for her, particularly as 2017/18 she will be in 3rd/4th year of studying which I do think is a fair request that marriage does not happen in that time period. The compromises are she accepts that I want to get married in late 2016, or I accept that we will get married in 2019; from what we see there aren't really other options.

I'll try to be brief -- I'm a graduate student starting a new job in September across the country. My fiancee (whose entire family lives here) originally told me she has no problem moving (before I even applied for the job), but now that it's getting closer she's panicking about being away from her family and makes it sound as if there's no way she would be happy leaving. I'm not sure what to do here -- she's known that there's basically no work for me in this state, and that marrying me essentially means moving away from home. The plan is to move shortly after the wedding, but what if she outright refuses to move, or realizes she's absolutely miserable living anywhere but near home?

I am the owner of a small business in the local area, hiring out plant machinery and doing contracting work. I have around 25 employees and hire out around 65 machines. Around a year ago, my girlfriend started to work there, doing a little bit of driving and office work, keeping a lot of accounting work together as my secretary was useless. I found out a few months ago that she has been bleeding money out of my company, and giving it to the guy she's been cheating with. She has taken around £53.5K and nearly sent the company into receivership. Had I not had a cheque bounce, I would never have checked any banking information and had all transactions stopped. She was an utter bitch to me, but I'm too soft, and forgave her, we're still together. The only thing is, she's back seeing the guy that is currently paying off my debts. I don't really know how to confront her about it, and wether or not we should break up. I know I probably sound like a complete ass, but I'm really unsure of what to do.

We've been together for 2 years this August. When we met, he had a high-paying job at an accounting firm, but realized that he hated the isolation and boredom and decided to go back to school. I recently completed my bachelor's degree and am looking into graduate school as well. Basically, we're not in any position to get married right now, even though we love each other and the subject has definitely come up. Now, his family is mostly easy to get along with, but they're very close-knit and get up each others asses quite frequently. Lately, his sister has been pestering me with all sorts of trivial questions. When's the wedding, you better not elope, etc. etc. His mother has also chimed in with wanting grandchildren and so forth. It doesn't sound that bad when I write it down like this, but I can tell that it embarrasses him when they do it, and they don't listen to me when I ask them to stop. I think part of his embarrassment comes from the fact that if he had kept his old job (the one that made him miserable, mind you), maybe we could afford a wedding. Even though it doesn't matter to me, he wants to buy me nice things, support me, etc. He thinks it's the ""gentlemanly"" thing to do. I think that's silly. I don't really know where to go from here. I know I'm not getting an engagement ring anytime soon, nor am I expecting one, haha. BUT, I wish that Mom and Sister would stop pestering poor Boyfriend before he has a nervous breakdown. He has anxiety problems, and overall I just feel bad! Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you deal with it? They're not doing anything mean-spirited, I just wish they would give it a rest for awhile...

(throwaway account) I've been dating this girl for a while and noticed a few things that have bothered me. First, I am 23 and she is 19 and we've been dating for over a year. The biggest thing is that she doesn't want me discussing our relationship with anyone. ANYONE. If we have a fight and I'm upset, I'm not allowed to call even my parents to talk about it. She found out I called my mom once after a fight and then got even more upset and now believes that my parents hate her (which they don't), and even after telling her that my parents don't hate her and that they probably understand that people in relationships have fights from time to time, she still won't believe me. This is really the part that bothers me, I believe I should be able to talk to at least my parents about MY life. To make it worse, I found out she had talked to her friends about our relationship, which really doesn't seem fair at all. To add to that, she never has anything nice to say about anyone. She's always commenting on how ugly this girl is, or how gross this guy is, or how stupid her project teammates are, or how badly someone is dressed. It's getting really irritating and I told her about her habit, which she responded by saying one nice thing the next day and then returning to her old ways.

A brief summary of a much longer more detailed story: I (18/f) have been dating 20/m for two years, at the beginning of which I was a very serious science geek, party goer and very pessimistic. I had just turned 16 and was fresh out of the a teenage phase where I sort of tried to fit in too hard with all my new ""cool friends"" and rejected my interests and general self. it was in that period that I first met him, but I developed depression just after starting the relationship, he was very romantic at first and a great lover, now he doesn't stir any intense emotions in me but fear and discontent, I still love him terribly though. From that depression I decided to embrace it instead of hiding, and learnt ways to calm my anger, so I picked up old hobbies and delved into philosophical ideas. However I became very different afterwards, I am finding myself becoming the opposite of him in every way and all common ground is slipping away. Now I love Hindu philosophy, art, history, and much of the things I loved so passionately before. Our relationship has taken a turn for the worst recently and I have spoken to him but nothing seems to change permanently. We seem to argue constantly about our different views and he has a habit of not allowing other viewpoints to be heard. I am constantly shot down and its spilling into everyday life. I have made the effort to learn a lot about things that interest him and our social ideas but it never seems to be enough and he makes no effort to understand what in saying. There is a breakdown of communication and I can seem to fix it. Is it something to work at, because I don't know if I still love him, there of course brief moments of joy, or are we drifting in two different directions?

My partner who is Bi (we both are) has never been the most color-by-number standard of masculinity, but a few weeks ago he started asking me if I would still like him if he was a woman, but did it in a sort of joking matter. A few days later, he brought it up again and dropped the bomb that he's been thinking that he's actually trans. From the conversations we have had since, it seems to me that he's not interested in hormone or surgeries. Yet, a few days later the idea of hormone therapy was something he sounded interested in. He wants to see a therapist beforehand, because he himself isn't sure if transitioning is what he really wants. Personally, I wouldn't want him to transition, but I am supportive if this is his ultimate choice. I think we should also going to couple's therapy, thoughts?

I've got a crush on an incredibly close friend I've made last year, who's unfortunately got an on-off girlfriend. Even worse, I told him my feelings when he got back together with her for the gazillionth time, in order to provide a reason as to why I'm becoming distant, and he goes ""oh shit, why didn't you tell me earlier, I feel the same"". The really shitty bit is that he's still dating this girl though, which is awful on both her and me, but I'm his emotional girlfriend anyway and it's wearing me down. We've got a super tight friends' group, so I can't remove myself from the situation - how the hell do I get over this crush without jeopardizing friendships?! He's constantly snapchatting and texting me, cockblocking boys from hitting on me by saying ""hey, don't hit on her she's taken!"", regardless of who I'm sitting next to he'll always wrangle a seat next to me, and is always about our future plans together - even to 10 years down the road. Every time I deviate the conversation to asking about his girlfriend, all he does is complain about her and then stare at me longingly. I've had enough. The worst thing is that I become firmly resolved, delete all his text messages and everything from snapchat, only to succumb a week later when he cracks an inside joke. Our friends' group is unfortunately very, very close and we hang out a lot. Even though I hang out with a ton of other people, these are the people who make me feel most comfortable. How on earth do I proceed to stop myself from crushing on him?

I feel like garbage. I broke up with my girlfriend for the fact that we can never truly be together, and committed, forever. The differences reside in our religious beliefs. We both tried to overcome this obstacle, but in the end, she wasn't willing to accept my beliefs (Atheist), and I wasn't willing to change to hers (Christian). Problem is, she's been living in my house since November, and I've been supporting her while she gets her finances back on track. Last week I decided that I could no longer invest the time and effort to something that can literally never lead to marriage, which is important to me. She has not yet had the chance to fully catch up on her bills, but I can no longer allow her to live with me and support her. Basically what this means is that she is going to have to move into some sketchy neighborhood to be able to afford to live on her own. I guess my question is, am I doing the right thing by forcing her to leave? I care for her safety, but it hurts to have her in my house when all I keep thinking is that we can eventually overcome this and be together. It's NOT possible though, and I'm just going to continue to hurt myself. At the same time, I don't want anything bad to happen to her. Any guidance is appreciated, and thanks in advance.

Hey folks, throwaway account for obvious reasons. I'm sure this happens and gets asked here all the time, but I'm not sure what to do. Earlier today, my wife [32/F] kicked me [25/M] out of our house because I wasn't being a partner to her or our marriage. We've been married for almost 4 years, and have known each other for 5. We don't have any children, but we do have a fur baby, whom we both love and adore. The problem I'm having is that I know I've been fucking up the last 3 years of our relationship, because I haven't completely grown up. I will constantly promise to do things with the complete and full intent to do them, but often don't. I also have a tendency to play video games as a way to escape life because I can't stand myself and doing things I don't like. I love my wife insanely, and I can't believe I've acted like an idiot and letting our relationship get this bad, to the point where she feels she can't even be around me. I know I have a lot to change about myself and I'm trying, so so so hard, but she's heard it all before and I keep going back to my same habits. Perhaps not as bad as before, but they feel that way to her. I'm not sure how to start a healing process for myself and for our marriage because I really, really, really want it to work, and I know I'm the one that has the responsibility now. Either I prove that I want it to work with my actions, or I prove that I don't. I'm scared because I worry that no matter how hard I try to prove to her that I do love her and want it to work, I won't be able to fix myself entirely to convince her.

I'm going to spend time with my girlfriend and meet her parents over christmas.

However, this is conceivably a girl I could settle down with. For this, i'd have to convert to Islam.

So to start off my fiancée (f22) and I (m22) have been together for a little under a year. I know it seems to be like we are moving fast and I feel that way sometimes too, I just can't imagine a life without her in it. She's my best friend and the woman of my dreams. This woman is truly amazing, even writing this I can't help but smile. We moved in together a little over 3 months ago and it has been working great. We clean the house together, cook together, really dont argue about trivial things like that. Although recently it seems she has been really upset with me, being that she feels I don't emote well. I can't argue this, my whole life I have been taught to bottle things up and deal with them on your own. I have been working on this a much as I can, and have been really trying to open up. Honestly she is the only person in my life I feel comfortable exposing myself to and letting down these walls Iv built up over the years. Recently she is upset with the fact that she feels she has to worry for the both of us. As in I'm always being an optimist and brushing problems off rather than opening up and talking about them with her. So I'm the ""happy"" one and in turn she feels the need to be the ""worried"" one. There's no doubt about it, i can see where she is coming from, and I guess I'm just coming to you guys to see how I can better open up with her. Recently Iv been trying to come to her with my work problems and vent a bit along with financial problems we have been having as of late. I really just dont know what I should do. I love this woman more than I can can even fathom, she's everything I want in a life partner and I really do not want to loose her de to my lack of openness.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a bit over a year and we're both each other's first for everything. I have a much higher sex drive than he does, but I have pared it down to suit his level, which I am okay with. The problem is sex. He was very hesitant to have sex (we were both virgins) and wanted to wait, so we abstained for over a year. About 3 months ago we finally lost our virginity to each other, and since then, we have sex about once a week when we see each other (due to distance). I would say that it makes up about a third of our sexual repertoire. I am on the pill and take it perfectly, so the risk of pregnancy is very low. Last night he dropped a bomb on me saying that he thinks we need to 'slow down' and not have sex as often. He said that it doesn't feel passionate to him and that though it feels good physically, it is nothing more to him than thrusting in and out of me. This just about killed me because I enjoy sex very much and find it very intimate. Not only that, but it really helped to satisfy my sex drive better than anything else. I don't know what to do now. I can't force him to have sex with me if he doesn't want to and I don't want him to do anything he doesn't feel comfortable with. I feel that he's being selfish for not considering my needs, but I also feel selfish for wanting sex so much. Advice?

So I'm a junior in high school. He's a senior. We've been friends this entire year and he's liked me from the beginning except for I was in a long term relationship. That ended it January and we started to have a thing in April. I was so happy with him but I was so hung up on my previous boyfriend and wanted something exactly like him so I was very distant. I guess he considered us to be dating while I was not on the same page because I was uncomfortable and unsure of what I wanted. Lack of communication. I had no idea he thought that. My friends also ended up playing a part. They didn't like him a whole lot because he didn't ""fit in"" and wasn't like my ex. So I had another friend that came to a party of mine. They kept pushing me and pushing me to give this guy a chance and I didn't really give in but I wasn't backing off his advances, which was wrong of me. I sat on his lap while playing super smash bros. That was really it. I thought I liked this new kid because he was like my ex. So in the midst of a mental breakdown a few days later, I ended it and went to the new guy. My ""boyfriend?"" heard that I sat on his lap so he wasn't happy.

Background: I've been seeing my girlfriend for almost 11 months. I still live with my parents, and due to outside circumstances, she lives with me in my room. Both of us are still in school, with me graduating at the end of the year. We plan on moving into our own apartment as soon as I am employed. I am her first boyfriend, and am the only person she has ever slept with. The other night, she mentioned that she was thinking of asking me about opening up our relationship. We talked about it quite a bit; it essentially boils down to me being the only guy she's ever really been involved with. Our relationship got pretty serious pretty fast as we became official about a week after we first started hanging out. She said that she didn't want to to do it because of wanting to sleep with other people, but because she wanted to experience ""what she was missing"" in terms of dating. Because of this, I asked if she wanted to essentially go on more dates with me, which she agreed to. I really don't want an open relationship because I get very anxious about her and I know that I would get jealous as soon as someone else became involved with her, so I see that as something that's completely out of the question. At the same time, I feel like I'm trapping her, what with her living with me and not being able to leave me without having to find somewhere else to live. That said, we really do love each other and have talked about marriage. Would taking her out on more dates be enough? I have absolutely no idea how to deal with this.

We've been together around six months now, he's an amazingly supportive person and I like to think we have a good relationship. But recently he's started bragging about his former conquests/hook ups and telling me how frequently women have been hitting on him. I'm not an overly jealous person, but I am quite insecure, and I don't want to hear about his former sexual encounters or about how many girls hit on him each day. We've never discussed our previous relationships/sexual partners until about a week ago, when he mentioned the fact that one of his female friends kept trying to hook up with him when they were drinking together (with other friends) a couple of months ago (when we were together) and that it was particularly awkward because they'd hooked up in the past. Okay, cool. He then went on to talk about several other girls he'd hooked up with when he was younger. I just nodded along, but to be honest I'm not sure why he brought it up in the first place. Today he mentioned that a girl was hitting on him excessively yesterday, and later again kind of randomly talked about another one of his previous sexual encounters. Any idea why he could have suddenly started doing this? It makes me feel really uncomfortable hearing these sorts of things. My last serious boyfriend was constantly hit on by his attractive female friends and ended up cheating on me with one of them. This is the first serious relationship I've been in since then (3+ years ago) and while most of my walls have come down and I'm learning to trust again, I'm still very insecure for this reason and constantly hearing about how attractive my boyfriend is to other girls is not helping. Any ideas as to why he's doing this all of a sudden? Am I overreacting? How should I go about addressing it?

A month ago, I stated that I'd rather find someone myself to do this with, and he agreed.

She told us about how she ""wishes she could find a real gentleman like me"" and said ""you probably wouldn't be interested ha ha!"" (not in a slutty way just a joking manner) but I wanted so bad to say ""ha ha you have no idea""... Today I had a dream with her in it which prompted me to make this post because I feel like shit and want to stop this. I've been going over more in hopes that her mom is there and when she isn't I feel ""down"" and looking at her facebook page even though I can't see much because I haven't added her and I'm not going to. So what the fuck? Like I said I really like my gf and am not trying to find some way to hurt her or do anything fucked up... I just don't know what to do.

I work in an office. My boss is apparently not the sharpest tool in the shed. I would like to preface this by saying she is VERY liberal for a Christian and that I don't think she has any ill feelings towards transgender people. I am transgender, but I look like a cisgender (""normal"") man after being on prescription testosterone for about 10 years. There is nothing about me that looks female and I think that's where my boss is having trouble. You see, every few days or once a week or so, she asks me what the pendant around my neck means. It's a triangle with the transgender symbol inside it. Every time, without fail, I tell her it's the transgender pride symbol. She **always** wants to know why I wear that and asks if I'm showing support for a friend or family member. I tell her I'm transgender. She **always** looks shocked and says, ""you want to be a woman?"" I inevitably reply with ""no, I was born a woman; being transgender goes both ways. There are men who were born women and women who were born men."" She always looks really stunned and says something to the effect of ""oh, wow"" and searches my face/body, probably looking for feminine features, then walks away. It continues to happen. It has been going on for close to six months now, since she became my boss. It started out funny, but now it's becoming irritating. Is there something wrong with the way I'm explaining it? How can I resolve this? I don't want to get rid of my pendant because I've worn it for 15 years and would honestly feel naked without it. Should I just lie and say it's related to something else?

I've been dating my boyfriend for a little less than a year now, and things have been going ok. This is my first serious relationship. This past 3 months, we've both been doing with some issues. He drinks a lot, and I have some problems with eating and food. His drinking problem has become so severe that recently I told him I needed a break, and we needed to solve our own problems before being together again. When I told him that, he told me he hasn't been happy for a long time, and we are too ""different"" and that I am not his soulmate. This is the first time he's told me this, and it was a huge shock to me. He still claims he loves me, and does not know what to do. Now I'm obviously heartbroken, hopeless and don't know what to do.

To start my boyfriend[20 then] said some stupid/hurtful things to me[18 then] when we first started dating. It wasn't a frequent thing, but the few times stuck with me. The way he said them wasn't in a ""mean"" way, they were just comments that hurt me. Examples are: -to be honest i thought you were below average in looks, but i fell for your personality -you were kind of chubby to be my type I'm 5'3 and weigh 125 is that helps. They were things that had to do with my apearance. And i guess even know when he compliments me, i don't really feel good because i just think about the past. When other people compliment me it's ok. I did end up telling him how all these things hurt me, he felt so guilty and didn't realize he was being so careless with his words. This is my first relationship so i think i was taken back from the things he said. I had a unrealistic idea that when i would be in my first relationship we would be madly in love with each other. We've been dating for 2 years now, he really has changed. Yet i'm the one that can't get over the past. I dont tell him, since we already talked about it and i thought i was over it then. He told me whenever i get drunk i end up crying and telling him how mean he is and how he only wants me for sex. He said how he worries that this is how i really feel and i'm not telling him. It makes him feel that I deserve a lot better. The problem is, i do love him. Yet i remember these things and my confidence in how he feels for me lessens. My confidence in myself is good, i think im not below average. Yet, not all the time but frequently, i feel ugly around my SO. Any advice in how to forget hurtful things SO said in the past?

I'm bisexual but not out to many and I have never been with a girl, although I have wanted to for a long time. At a festival I volunteered at 3 months ago I was put on shift with a girl I'll call Hannah. Me and Hannah spent a lot of time together on shift and using her sharp gaydar I'm pretty sure she began to suspect I liked girls, so she dropped a few hints that she was gay and then made a few passes at me. I was too shy to reciprocate, especially because at that point I wasn't out to the people I attended the festival with, who me and Hannah were also working with. I stupidly left my last shift without her number and never saw her again. So today while scrolling through the volunteer group Facebook page I found a post by someone that looked a lot like her had made about a week ago, and it did turn out to be Hannah. (Not that I've been looking for her for the last 3 months, or anything.) Would it be weird to add her on Facebook and try and talk to her, or has it been too long? I feel pretty stupid for still thinking this over this 3 months later and I'm worried that I might come across as really creepy. I know this seems really trivial, but I would love for my first experience with a girl to be with her.

I am 19 my x is 18. We will call her h. So she spent Christmas Eve at my sisters with me and my whole family. We were drinking. I was feeling so anxiety I threw up. By this point I wasn't really talking to her. Until we went outside. Then we talked a little. And it was a lot better. Eventually we get to the point of being shit faced. So I took her upstairs to the bathroom. Showed her, her bed. She asked me to stay. So I did. And one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. I found out she has this piece of shit boyfriend. Who doesn't want to associate with her at parties. Doesn't trust her. Looks through her phone etc. So she left and started texting me. Then texted about Hooking up again tonight. After a couple texts she completely changed her mind. She felt that it wasn't even cheating but I'm the right thing for her. And dating this guy is cheating. He has erectile dysfunction. What is going on in her head right now? She also isn't one to cheat

So here's the short. I helped a close friend of mine make some decisions that we both regret, involving cheating on her now ex. We fostered a closeness and pseudo-relationship for several months. Both agreed to be exclusive after some consideration, but never anything official. If anyone is going to try and beat a dead horse, I recognize that my decision was inconsiderate, destructive, and pointless. Her relationship was 2 years. Moving on. I tried what I could to support her and let her make her own decisions. She felt that she could get past all that upset her and be happy with me. Months later, she still felt guilt being with me. In hindsight, it was slowly spilling into resentment. She became easily frustrated and angry with me. I asked her, directly, if she ever felt bad after sex, if she ever felt upset and unhappy. She sighed, and said that she still felt guilt and unhappiness the day following an evening with me. We agreed that it would be best to separate. Even if the situation was shit, she was the first person I really loved. It's been extremely hard on me, but I know I'm doing the right thing for her by pushing away and keeping distance. I see her at least 3 times a week in class, unavoidably. I cry about it still, every now and then. It was hard at first, and hardest when I found out she was seeing someone else within a few weeks. Been trying to keep myself doing different things, got a tinder account to meet new people, had a lunch date today. It still hurts and it's been something like a month. What else can I do? I feel so defeated and drained anymore.

Alright so a couple months ago me and my girlfriend of three years hit a huge bump before I went off to college. I was spying on her Tumblr account (as well as Facebook and Twitter) as in I was logged in so I could see everything (feel free to call me out on that). Anyways, one day on her Tumblr one of those ""Daddy"" characters (yes we are kinky like that) started sending her personal messages and SHE ended up asking HIM for his Kik! Now I wasn't logged into her Kik account, so I never got to see what was messaged. I confronted her on it and we were in a huge fight where I was made out as the bad guy for being logged in to her accounts. Now she claims that she never sent him nudes or talked dirty or anything, but I am still very skeptical. She claims that she only messaged him in order to receive advice. I haven't been logged into anything since the confrontation. Now my main concern is do I believe her? It has been months and I still feel it hanging over our relationship. I consider this cheating if she was talking dirty/sending nudes to some fucking stranger. She deleted the Kik account and the messages are gone.

i was in a relationship recently for a few years with the guy who i was to marry. we' talked about the wedding, everyone in our lives knew we'd get hitched eventually. we were each others everything. passionate about each other in every way. it was nothing i'd ever felt before (and may never feel again). but it was too strong. the intensity turned into jealousy and insecurities from both of us, and things got toxic. we couldn't be happy, despite loving each other tremendously. so we ended it. and it fucking hurt. enter new guy- he's great. he's absolutely everything i thought i wanted in a person. i'm not AS attracted to him, but that might go along with my mental barriers. i don't feel passionate about him. i don't run to him when i'm feeling insecure or sad, my heart doesn't skip a beat when he walks in the door. i like him fine, but i can't figure out if he;s just not right for me or if i'm comparing my feelings about him to the feelings i had in my previous relationship, or i'm protecting myself and not allowing myself to fall for him because i'm scared that he'll jump ship anyways and i'll be left in the dust. there's a lot of baggage and insecurities here. I know, and he knows it too and has committed to being along for the ride. he says he loves me and has never felt about anyone the way he feels about me. so then i ask too, am i trying to talk myself into staying with him just because he fits the bill of my dream guy and is in love with me and openly accepts my flaws? do i feel obligated to love him back?

Hi, guys. I'm looking for some support. Me and my boyfriend had been dating for 2 years. We lived together and went to the same university. He has depression and that affected our relationship sometimes. I thought everything was perfectly fine in the relationship until I got a text while at school that basically said he no longer loved me and to come pick up my things. Within the hour, my long term relationship had ended over a text message and all my things were packed and moved. I was completely blindsided to say the least. I never expected any of this and I'm honestly still floored, even though it's been over a week. We have nothing but mutual friends, so I can never hang out with them because he's always taking up their time. We've talked a few times and I've asked him to try things with me again (I shouldn't have done this- I later realized) but he said no. I asked if we should move on and he said ""I don't know"". I'm scared to move on and try to find someone else because I would still like to date him in the future. I'm scared to stand still because he might move on and then I'm stuck in a rut. I've tried making a Tinder but I'm not ready for a new relationship and am giving myself time to heal. I've never been broken up with over no reason. I haven't gotten a definite reason out of him yet. I don't know what to do and I'm looking for support and guidance.

He is willing and wants to do everything besides actual PiV but I don't know how long I can last.

I and my current love interest (we'll call her Donna) met through her sister (we'll call her Sarah), who I had been interested in before her. Basically, Sarah and I dated very briefly before I met Donna, and Sarah and I remained close friends after our first failed foray into a relationship. A couple years later, Donna and I have started really hitting it off, but due to distance (I was in college, she is still in high school) and parents (who just do not like me for who knows what reason) we have never been able to make the relationship serious. Over a year ago, during a time Donna and I weren't able to stay in contact very well, Sarah was having problems with her boyfriend and separated. She confided in me, and emotionally manipulated me on my birthday into fooling around with her--we spent a day together at a theme park, where she was clinging to me and pressing some male buttons until we came back to my house and were relaxing before going to the movies. This is when she went all-out, and I succumbed to some male passions and we had a heavy-petting session until we went to the movies. Again, Donna and I hadn't been in contact for a while, and we weren't in a romantic relationship at this point. Fast-forward to now. Donna and I were in a good spot, communicating frequently and even managing to go out on an all-day date. She hears the story about Sarah and I, and our relationship is in a bad spot. She now believes I'm using her as a replacement for her sister, regardless of my attempts to assuage those fears. Does anybody have any experience with situations like this and have something that might work? I really like Donna and don't want to have the relationship end because of a misunderstanding like this.

(My GF and I have been together almost three months.) Both of these two friends have been my friends since highschool. My GF has only known them both for a year, but my GF is best friends with Cassy, and Cassy told her about this issue in secret. Apparently, George knows about it, and is a dumbass and wants to ""work through it."" My GF told me not to tell anyone, because she doesn't want Cassy to know she broke her confidence. But I'm not going to be friends with Cassy. Besides the fact that she cheated on George, she's also done a whole host of other things that makes me not want to be friends with her. So I blocked her on FaceBook, Twitter, instagram, the works. Now her BF, George, texted me, asking what my issue is with his girlfriend. I'm not sure what to do. 1. I don't text back. I just stay out of it, never text him back. The problem is, is eventually, I WILL see them both in person. 2. I text him back part of the details. I tell him everything that bothers me about her, BESIDES the cheating stuff. But then this might make it awkward in public when we all hang out. 3. I just say fuck it and tell him, ""BECAUSE SHE CHEATED ON YOU."", and hope my GF doesn't get too mad. Total honesty, all out there, and no awkwardness in public. Which should I do?

First time posting here. Around the first year mark of our relationship, we would actually do quite a bit together. Fast forward to now, and we barely see each other. We live in separate houses(with our parents due to money issues), but play games online(we're gamers). Or at least we used to. I got him a job working where I work, 9 months later he quits(it is a shit job). While he worked there, we played games/saw each other almost never. He slept all the time and I slipped into severe depression due to unrelated things. After he quit, I thought we would do more, but when we are both online, he never asks me to do anything with him, he just goes and gets busy with something else. And when we hang out in person(once a week since he seems to be doing things with other people all the time), he just wants to have sex. Major problem: I have almost no desire for sexual interaction with anyone or myself. I attribute this mostly to the depression along with some other factors(I've always found the idea of sex gross). What I want: I'm bored all day now, I want to play games again. Mainly, when he comes over, I want to lay my head on his chest and be happy, not in his lap and hate myself. I want to just feel loved without having to put sex on the table. I feel like a kid with my vision of love. Love to me is about feeling safe with someone. Its about wanting to be around them, and not just because you want a booty call. Its about having more fun with them than you ever could with someone else. Aside from this, he is the nicest person I've ever met. He has a huge heart, but this year I just feel alone, and I normally like a lot of alone time, so this feeling is pretty strong.

Dear reddit, My boyfriend and I have been dating for nearly 3 years. He's always expressed, even to this day, how he's completely in love with me and how he's crazy about me etc etc. HOWEVER he is in a big party fraternity and early in our relationship, although he didn't cheat on me, he did flirt with a lot of girls for ego validation and attention. Fast forward to yesterday- my bf is on vacation to Alaska and he hasn't had service because he's on a cruise but the few times we can talk, he tells me he has a gift for me. I wanted to reciprocate that, so I was looking for different gifts I can get for him. He is a musician so I wanted to get him something related to music. I couldn't call or text him cause he's overseas so I decided I'd maybe get some clues by going on his fb (he gave me his password himself so I thought he has nothing to hide). I briefly skimmed through a convo with his best friend whom he always talks with about music, and found recent conversations where he's obsessing about other girls and talking about ""the struggle"" of it. And how he hopes that the cruise he's on has unattractive people because he doesn't want to get tempted and he's extra flirtatious on vacations. I already have trust issues with him- I used to find so many flirtatious texts with other girls in the past (not anymore), but this makes me lose all faith and hope in him. Maybe I am overreacting- but that is why I am on here asking for advice. To me, I think: Does he need to have ugly people around him to want to stay loyal to me? Is that what it really takes? I thought we had a serious relationship. I don't want to be in a relationship where I am always on edge about whether or not my partner wants to be faithful to me. I want to know for a fact that he would love to be faithful to me just because he loves me. Please tell me your thoughts on this, and be honest- I hate constantly feeling like this with him and I am considering breaking it off.

She's going to therapy now and wants to remain friends with the intent that we potentially date again when she gets herself squared away. Since then it's been about three weeks which have been utter hell. We've talked about things a few times and it feels like I'm slowly pushing her away.

Started seeing my now girlfriend in the summer, august (UK) we are from totally different backgrounds, but both passionate about horses. Summer ended, I'm back at university, she is working. Things continued at a slower pace but the excitement of seeing each other was pretty awesome.. I would come back from uni most weekends and we would do all the ""normal couple stuff"" I've met her family and we have told each other we love each other quite a long time ago.. We did have a pretty amazing thing going on. I left the country (organised well before we met - I did tell her early on and we both thought it would be fine.. ((we're stronger than this etc)) So as I see it, I'm slowly drifting out of her life little by little. She has told me how she has been hurt so many times and never felt like this with anyone. I am passionately in love with this girl/woman. She told me she needs space and tells me she has depression.. I read up about depression r/depression is actually really handy. She tells me its been over a month now but she has just been hiding it.. ( i left on the 16th of dec, so it started about 2-3 weeks beforehand. I'm lost, i feel inadequate, i think about her all the time, I'm angry, an then really sad.. I then tell myself stupid shit like ""she is acting"" ""attention seeking"" ( i won't lie she was always a bit needy.. now i feel like a total dickhead writing this as its only now becoming clear. This is my first proper relationship. I need advice. I'll be back in the UK in about 12 days, we have been radio silent (no text or phoning) for about 48 hours, which is a first. but she wished me happy christmas and send me two snapchats (i haven't opened them) I'm trying really hard to just let her be alone ever since she asked for space.

We've been together about nine months and everything was fine until a few months ago. What initially started our dry spell was me switching birth control and having pretty intense spotting for a month straight, so we just didn't do it. After that it was very rare that we did and anytime I'd bring it up he would just defensively refer to the month that I couldn't and change the subject. The only physical intimacy I get is when he lets me cuddle up to him as I'm falling asleep and when he gives me a quick kiss on his way out the door. Everything else about the relationship is fine, we see each other often, my birthday was a week ago and he had this really great weekend planned for me. So it doesn't seem like he isn't feeling the relationship anymore. It wasn't that long ago that we were appalled to hear that a friend of his who had just gotten married hadn't had sex with his new wife in over a year, but they were totally fine with that. Is that us now? I'm not sure if it's my depression and anxiety taking over, but lately I have this intense feeling of dread that I just can't shake.

This makes me feel like a jerk. I've been with my girlfriend a bit over a year, and I'd say we were ""effectively"" together for 6 months to a year before that. I took things very, very slowly (a rarity for me) based on a number of factors. One of them was her age. One of them was the fact that she has some very serious psychological and emotional issues and I knew it would be irresponsible of me to just dive into a relationship thinking I could fix them (I've had a long string of issues with trying to ""fix"" girls in the past). After courting for a very long time and getting to know each other very well, I believed I was ready for the relationship, despite everything. She has so many positive qualities that I believed were worth the effort. I also believed her issues would get better. I'll be honest, I really didn't come close to understanding the depth of how serious these things can be. I've learned a huge amount about depression, eating disorders, and a host of other issues. I've gained a huge amount of empathy on the subjects. With that said, I just don't feel like I can take it anymore. Nothing is getting better. She's making little or no effort to get better, and often claims she doesn't want to get better. I know these are symptoms of the very diseases she's trying to treat, but I'm not a psych professional. I don't know what else I can do other than offer support and encourage her to seek treatment. I have a laundry list of reasons and excuses ranging from bullshit to (I believe) legitimate, but none of them are stopping me from feeling like a complete bastard for abandoning someone who's still in need. I know I'm the only pillar of emotional strength that she has, and the idea of just leaving her high and dry makes me sick. But it's killed all the passion and love in the relationship. I don't think I want to be here anymore, but I'm scared to leave. I don't think this is an especially novel situation. I'm sure a lot of people have been through it. Maybe some perspective or some advice will help me figure out what I should do.

So about a month ago I started dating this girl I met online and we instantly hit it off. We've been hanging out a lot over the course of the last month (I already deactivated my online dating profile) and we get along really well. She just found out shes leaving for another country in two short weeks for work (long story and if I share it I'm nervous she'll know it's about us). She'll be home in 4 weeks so it's not like it's forever. Anyway, how do I proceed in this situation? We're not even officially a couple, but I planned to have the exclusive talk this week, but this news is now confusing how I should proceed. I can deal with 4 weeks, it's just I guess I'm nervous she'll interpret the exclusive talk as a knee jerk reaction. What should I do? And what's the best way to deal with communication that's long-distance?
