Hello hello everybody. I hope this isn't too trivial of a question to ask on here, but I've been feeling a bit out of my depth when it comes to this situation (I've had only one relationship before, and for many reasons, it was out of the ordinary). Okay! So, a couple of weeks ago, I started talking to this guy on Facebook, through a student group that we were both part of. I thought he was sort of cute, so I sent him a PM just to talk, etc, etc. We're both transfer students at the same school, so I knew that we could eventually meet in person once we both moved on-campus. So, we did, and we hung out maybe twice, just as friends. Okay. So, everything is going pretty well. We talk over Facebook and Snapchat, whatever. So, Saturday night, I was just hanging out with people and kind of being bored, when I got a Snapchat from him asking what I was doing. I asked if he wanted to hang out, so we did. We ended up smoking pot (the first time for me, ever), and sort of just wandering around. Eventually we ended up back at his dorm room, where high me decided to just go for it, and I came on to him pretty strongly. It worked out for me (luckily, otherwise things would have been really super awkward), and we ended up messing around but not having sex. Yesterday, however, I ended up going to hang out with him again, and this time we did sleep together. Afterward, we kind of discussed what we were going to do, and he just said that he wanted to ""play it by ear"" and not slap any labels on anything. I'm wondering if this means that he wants a fwb-type situation, or if he might actually be interested in me. The way I've been acting is extremely out of character for me, and I am not interested in having a fuck buddy. I like him, and I would be very interested in maybe seeing where things go, but I'm worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship by sleeping with him already.

She gets terrible service while at her house, but I texted her 3 times yesterday, 4-5 hours apart. She didn't call me until early this morning and left a voicemail that she was busy all day with a friend who showed up out of the blue. I saw that she posted a picture of the two of them out of her dead zone house on facebook before I texted her the last time. I don't mind that she hangs out with friends, and I know it's pretty early in the relationship, but am I wrong to be a little annoyed that she didn't respond until 24 hours after my first text?

Wife and I moved accross the country with our two daughters <our dream. We settle in, happy, rosey veiws, living the dream or so I though. 6mo later she sleeps with a co-worker. I find out about it four months later on my birthday. Shit hits the fan at home and work - she and d-bag are fired. Did I mention she work for a Christian organization?

Hi guy's I just need some advice to calm my nerves. So I have been dating this guy for 2 years since we were the age of 14. The most we have done is make out and cuddle, that's it nothing more. We are only 16 and I was wondering is it a bad thing we have not done anything sexually for the 2 years we have been dating? because you hear of people taking it slow, but are we going to slow? I have not spoken to him about this, but I just need an outside opinion on this before I do. Because I don't want to mess this up, I really love this guy

Ok so perhaps this isn't the most dramatic thing you have seen on this subreddit but I feel like I'm stuck. I have been friends with this girl for a while now asking her and things were going great until I asked her to prom. I am hoping this will be a great night however ever since I asked her a couple weeks ago I find I can no longer talk to her. Out conversations are awkward with me trying to start the majority of topics (Badly written but you get the picture) I really like the girl but i'm wondering if she saw too much into the prom-posal. Should I just give up, or ask her out? Im not sure

Basically this is just something that has been bugging me for a while and want to know what you guys think. I met this girl Cara when I was in college. We were both in long distance relationships throughout college so we never dated, but I flirted my dardnest with her. Fast forward to graduation, I end up breaking up with my LDR and Cara moves about two hours away, gets engaged. I would talk to her semi-regularly during this time. Some time passes and she gets ready to move far away to grad school, I'm bummed by this, but she keeps saying she wants to see me before she leaves. We plan a night to go to dinner. She drives the two hours down to my house, we have an awesome night out, dinner, drinks. Go back to hang back at my house. I so desperately want to make a move, but the whole thing about her being engaged and not wanting to make things weird get in the way. We hug, say our good byes, and I figure that's the last time I'll see her maybe ever. She texts me at 3 AM when she gets home and says she wants to hangout again. Now I'm really thrown through a loop. She comes back down two days later, we go out for drinks again and we end up watching fireworks on a freaking boat. I was so god damn close to just kissing her but I didn't do it. And now she's married. Did I fuck up? Was I just reading too much in to it? She was a pretty conservative girl (never saw her flirting with other guys). None of her friends really liked her BF and would sometimes insinuate that we would be better together. Not that any of this matters at this point. When I get drunk I think about texting her asking if I should have made a move that night, but never actually do it. Thoughts?

I know we are all human here, and we all find people attractive. I'm happy to discuss beautiful people with my SO, but over the last few days a few comments just seem unnecessary. Why do you find it necessary to tell me that you like the way some reality show girl moved her mouth, (""Ooo, I like THAT."") Or, when discussing acceptable age differences in relationships, tell me that you would gladly fuck a 15 year old but not date her. This stuff feels hurtful but I cannot intellectualize why. It feels very sexually aggressive and almost disrespectful. Is it unreasonable that this stuff makes me uncomfortable? We have been dating for about 4 months now, and I feel like this is just a sign of sloppiness. I reacted in the moment to his comment about that girls mouth, saying ""okay cool, I'll leave you to look at girls mouths and I'll head home."" and then he will cling to me saying ""no, don't go,"" kissing me, telling me he loves me..... I've also noticed an increase in the amount of ""play"" kissing (I don't know if other people do this, but it's just a playful kinda mouth thing...) versus actual kissing. I've been staying over his apartment (or he stays with me) most every night since we became monogamous. I'm wondering if this is all a sign that he is just comfortable and expects me to be there all the time. Maybe some distance would be good. I'm afraid though that he will interpret me spending less time with him as a decrease in affection, however... Why do some dudes act like this? I am not sexually inhibited. I casually sexed a good deal while single, and I can recognize an attractive man. But I don't feel compelled to inform him in the way he seems compelled to inform me. So I guess my main curiosities are: Is this a typical dude thing? Is it a sign of comfort level in the relationship? Is he being rude or am I just projecting my own insecurity?

Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks. I live in Oregon, she's attending school on campus in Utah, but lived in Oregon. I visit her once a month for about a week. Last visit (march 31-apr6) she was super distant and snappy towards me, I brushed it off assuming she was stressed with school and work Four days ago (4/16) she says that she thinks we should take a break so she can focus on school and work, but when she comes home for the summer (June) we'll be stronger. I was recently hanging out with one of our mutual friends and she asked me how we were doing. I told her about our break and she decided to Facetime her. I stayed in the room and listened (instant regret) My GF of almost one year (April 25th) was talking with passion in her voice about this dark skinned handsome boy genius who owns his own business at 21, and that she's spent the night at his house three different times. Our friend asked her if they did anything she responded with ""Not what you think but two other things."" My stomach sank and I just don't know how to handle this. I'm going to call her when she gets off work in about an hour and confront her about it.

I'm a uni student, and every monday I take this particular 3 hour module. Now there's this girl in the course, which we shall call Mandy, who is very active in class. The particular course is a gender studies-related course, but her responses in class have set her apart from the other girls, because she does not give typical feminine responses, yet she has shown herself to be a very spunky person. On the other hand, I'm also one of the more active contributors in class, as I'm one of the few guys in class, and I'm the one most likely to speak my mind, usually about controversial topics. And there have been times when we have been involved in arguments during the classroom. Anyway, I've found myself interested in her around 3 weeks into the class, because I was very attracted by her personality and her brains. I also found out that she was actually from my year, and I've tried finding opportunities to talk to her before or after class. Usually we will sit in separate rows in class, because she would usually sit with her friend, and I would sit with my group of friends. But last week, I just went to sit beside her, and tried my best to seem natural about it. I don't think she minded, because as far as I could tell, she's not really close to any of the coursemates. In fact, every time I see her out of class, she's not interacting with others, even the people who were sitting beside her. However, until now, I haven't had an opportunity to ask for her number, because I didn't want to scare her off. I wanted to add her on Facebook, but she doesn't have an account. The class is going to end in two weeks time, and I really want to grab this opportunity to at least ask her out before I possibly never see her again. Even if it doesn't work out romantically or anything like that, I would love to have her as a friend, because I think she's awesome that way, but I just don't know how to get closer to her. Please help!

Hey guys first post here. So I'll try to make this quick, I've been out of the dating scene for a few years now and need advice with a girl i currently like. Her and I met in class and have been talking for not too long a month or so. We have tons in common I have gotten her number and we text every now and then (more on that later.) But I have really I've made the most progress in the past week. So everything explained further takes place in a span of a week. I've hung out with her a few times. The times we have hung out have been good we seem to hit it off. She's kinda touchy and takes lots of pictures of us (bff on sc if that means anything.) She said things like I'm special for getting to see her act in her goofy way. She even made and brought me a sandwich for when we were studying together. But ever since then she seems less interested in me and we do not text as often. Which is weird cuz that was to me at least the time we hit it off the most. Before We had been texting all day but now barely at all and remember this is all in a span of less than a week. Most recently we were supposed to hangout but she said she forgot (which is a big red flag I know) but we did reschedule for another specific day. So is she uninterested? Playing hard to get? Or other?

I'm feeling really hurt. My boyfriend (M28) and I (F27) have been in a serious relationship for two years. Everything's been wonderful and I'm very happy. However, we're still not living together because he's ""not ready yet."" There's really no reason why we can't live together. We both make great money, have little to no debt and our jobs are in the same area. But he says he's not ready. He informed me last week that he's going to build a house and is going to look at land with a realtor next week. WTF!? He didn't discuss any of this with me or ask for any of my input. There's nothing wrong with the house he's living in right now. I don't understand. After two serious years together, don't you think a girlfriend should have some kind of input if you're planning on building a future with her? Is this any of my business?

Broke up with my girlfriend earlier this year around February because we didn't feel like things were working out (1.5 years together). I was in a bad state and wasn't sure if I wanted to take the relationship any further. That said she is a fantastic person and I wanted to remain friends with her, so we have up until recently. Around 2-3 months ago she stated getting serious with another guy and he hates the idea of her having anything to do with me. He insisted she stop talking to me, she said no at first and we met occasionally for coffee, talked on Facebook etc etc. He got really upset about it though and we agreed to scale things back a bit and only meet occasionally, every 2-3 weeks or so. Recently I get a message from her saying ""She doesn't want to talk to you!"". After meeting with her again it turns out that he has been checking her phone and making her feel guilty about talking to me. He has also hijacked her phone and blocked me on Facebook/Snapchat several times and has done this for another male friend of hers too. I realise that as the ex-boyfriend he may see me as a threat but this whole thing is really bumming me out. She is a great person and a great friend, I can't help but feel like this new guy is trying to control her life a bit too much. I don't know what to do, I want to stay friends with her, but I can't so much as drop her a message without her new boyfriend having a melt down. I offered to talk with him to explain I mean no harm, but he refuses to talk to me.

My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for nearly 2 years and last year it turned into a long distance relationship. Meanwhile we have come to the conclusion, that we want to live in the same country and move in together. My family expects me to get married in order to live with my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I, we are both okay with that. The problem is, that my parents don't know about him yet. I have never told them because I was pretty sure, that they won't accept him for one specific reason. And I am so sure, as I hear how they talk about other couples, that shouldn't be together in their opinion and in general am aware of their point of view on these matters. Actually there is a very small chance, that they might be okay with him because only his mother has a different cultural background and at the same time there is still a big chance, that they might be against him. This means telling them about him will probably cause a conflict. The mood in the house will drop because of me, there will be disussions because of me, very dramatic and emotional discussions, everybody will be devestated because of me... All in all everything will feel dark and cold the following days. This scenario took place once in my lifetime because of a similar topic. For this reason I am really afraid to tell them. But that is, what I want to do tomorrow or the day after. I really want to speak to them about him. What I am hoping for is to get some advice on how to handle this conversation, some motivational stories with happy endings, speeches about how I will regret not to tell and so on... I really need that right now :( Some side notes: I won't talk about marriage to my parents. That would be too much in the beginning:) I'll just mention, that I have a boyfriend and hope they'll accept it one day. Of course I will remain calm throughout the conversation. That is very important, I think. My boyfriend knows about these issues and he understands me. I wanted him to know because otherwise it would not be fair to him. Luckily he has always been very patient.

...and it is really starting to upset me. We've been dating for a while, I knew he was a gamer and that was part of the appeal. But I'm finding it more and more annoying when he ignores me to talk to people he's never met. I'm right here, in flesh and blood, trying to talk about my day or my problems or wanting some sexy times and he'll ignore me.

I [24M] met a nice girl [22F] on Tinder last week, though I don't hold much stock in Tinder. I got her number and we texted all week, and we seemed to get a long very well. So We decided to meet for drinks on Friday, it just so happened to be my birthday too. I haven't been on a date like this in a while so I was nervous but I do well under pressure. I felt like it went well, but of course, I expect first dates to be a little shaky which is normal I think. I kept things light, I didn't talk about serious personal stuff and kept it short, about 2 hours. We left, walked her to her car, a little ""nice to meet you"" hug, and just your basic talk to you later kind of goodbye. This morning, asked her how she though it went and was told it was bad. Apparently it was some things I said. Of course, she didn't tell me what those things were and stopped texting me and unmatched me on Tinder. There's not much point in trying to remember all the things I said, but shit...I would like to know. I guess I'm just upset because she just slammed the door on me. Anybody else deal with this? Any ideas? Im not trying to fix anything, I just want to learn from my mistakes.

I'll keep this brief. There are a lot of issues in the relationship. Big issues that arent going to resolve anytime soon, and are deal-breakers for me in the long-run. I realized not long ago that I need to let this relationship go. That said, she moved a long way to be with me, and we have a lease together. She still believes in the relationship. Supposedly. I'm not sure how long we can go with almost no-affection either way before she stops believing in it. I'm the only one paying rent and for most things, so I dont want to just leave her homeless.

My girlfriend and I started as a long distance relationship when we were in high school. We met three times over the years, each time for about a week, before moving in together during the beginning of this year. Initially, our sex life was pretty great. We had sex all the time and everything was fine. Lately, though, I've been wanting to less and less and it's really hurting her self esteem and making her feel like I'm unattracted to her. This may get a bit graphic, I just want to let you guys know why I'm not really that into it anymore in the hopes that you'll have some kind of advice as to what I can do. So generally, when we begin having sex, it's awesome. But after about a minute or so, it's like my dick goes numb. It makes it very difficult to stay into it, even though I enjoy pleasuring her. This makes me kind of dread having sex because I know it'll just end up being me trying everything I can do to make her feel good, while I'm just kind of there wishing it'd be over. Lately, we probably only have sex about once or twice a week, which is really messing with her self esteem issues. I feel awful everytime she tries to initiate it, because I just really don't want to and I know it'll end up making her feel awful. I have no idea what to do. I should probably just suck it up and do it for her. I've tried talking to her about it, but she takes it all so personally. Maybe it's just the way I phrase it. Are there any ways I can make myself more interested in having sex?

I care about people in general, but when it comes down to individuals, I get so bored and annoyed with other people's lives. Most people don't genuinely care about how their cashier's day is going when they ask, but I feel like that about everybody, including my best friends. When my friends tell me stuff about their lives, it's all I can do to concentrate enough that I can respond appropriately. This makes me feel really narcissistic and just like a terrible friend in general, but I just can't bring myself to actually care about why somebody broke up with their SO or where they're going for spring break. Since sharing stuff like that is a big part of friendship, I feel like I'm not actually friends with any of my friends. I've been sharing less and less with them too, as I wonder if my friends are thinking the same thing when I talk. The only person who I think I genuinely care about is my boyfriend. And now I'm worried that that care will fade and our relationship will end because of my apparent narcissism. Anybody ever felt like this?

So my relationship with my father is a strained one with a long history of arguments, hurt feelings, neglect and guilt. Growing up lets just say he was a less than attentive father and I came to terms with it fairly quickly in life. My mother and father have been separated since I can remember and both were very young when they had me. Without going in depth with my entire childhood we'll just say I never felt welcome and always felt like a huge burden in every sense to both of my parents. Living with my father it was especially hard when he chose his new wife and her daughters over me. Parties were attended, family photos were captured and trips to who-knows-where happened without me. Through this I learned independence and self-sufficiency where I kind of just accepted it and figured it wasn't worth my time to yearn for attention. However, Recently we've found a lull in or out bursts and have been really calm. Lately we've been trying to have conversations about whatever nonsense comes up and small talk here and there. For god sakes we teamed up the other day to change all four rotors on my car so that I could be done before nightfall. It's been an interesting last 10 months... I'm completely able to be on my own and financially stable, but I just haven't decided to up and desert the man yet. Maybe its my ENTJ nature where I cut losses and move on but I can feel that my father and I will not have a strong enough bond after we move on to pretend to be related. I think I've accepted this already and it's a shame. Knowing that for years I'll probably forget about him and even worse is that maybe when I have grandkids that they'll probably never meet grandpa.

So we've been married for quite a while, and get along famously on nearly everything. Except for one category, and that's the general sanitation level of things. We both like to keep an orderly house, but specifically I mean things like sitting on a bed after having worn pants outside and sat down places.

The reason this bugs me from a relationships point of view is that while so far I've tried to just be glad that she's clean and tidy instead of falling to the other side of things and picking my battles elsewhere, this wears on me when through shock and surprise she kind of makes me feel like I was raised in a barn. I am truly not sure whether I am in the wrong or is she on some of these things though. I don't possess the exact biological knowledge to say whether there's is reason or rhyme to this type of thing, but in general I just don't stress over the bottom of a piece of luggage that truly makes me wrong for putting it on the bed. I don't know. Or if it's normal to feel the need to run a bleach only cycle to ""clean out"" the washing machine after a load of soiled laundry went through previously.

I've had a crush on this guy from my gym for the past 2 years. Long story short, I found out he was interested in me back in May and we started texting. We always planned to meet at the gym at the same time. He actually seemed pretty shy because he would never say hi to me at the gym first. I'd always have to approach him first, but we'd have decent conversation, and he'd always hug me goodbye. We went on our first date after 2 weeks of texting & meeting up at the gym, and the date went really well, but he just stopped talking to me for no reason after this. He just ignored me at the gym and stopped responding to texts. Two weeks ago, we match on Tinder and I message him on there. He tells me to text him and we talk for like two days, then he disappears again. Two days ago, he randomly texted me and said ""I wanted to talk to you at the gym, but you're always talking to other people."" I asked him to just come up and talk to me, and he goes ""Idk why I do or don't do things. I'm weird and just really shy."" Then he send me a shirtless pic of himself. I saw him at the gym yesterday, we talked, and he gave me a hug before I left. I texted him today and he responded, but when I invited him to go out with me and my friends tonight, he just never replied. I don't get if he's just fucking with me or what.

To provide more color, I find it uncomfortable when I randomly click on my girlfriend's Facebook pictures, because her ex is in about half of them. What makes it extra weird is that I knew the guy/was kind of friends with him at one point in time while the two of them were dating. Additionally, the two of them were together for 5 years. Admittedly, I am a pretty insecure dude, and when I see the pictures I imagine how they were together, and if she said the same things to him she said to me, if they did the same things together that we do, how their sex was, if their sex was better than ours, etc. So I suppose the pictures just trigger all of that. We don't have any recent pictures of each other on Facebook either. I am fine with this, and that doesn't need to change. However, the most recent pictures she has is of this person with whom she was with for 5 years. So with both of those things in conjunction with one another, it makes me feel weird and kind of sad. For the record, I always untag myself from pictures with any of my exes. I treat these pictures as my memories, my history, and in the past. Keeping the pictures on Facebook keeps the memories in the present.

Last night I left the bar early with my friends because I was tired and bored. My boyfriend was there and had planned on leaving too and watching a movie with me. But he forgot about this when his friends told him they were coming to the bar we were at. He said he would stay only about 15 minutes then leave. Well he ended up staying more than an hour and a half. A little after two My bf texts me ""I should just come over and crash at your place"". Guys can't sleep over in my sorority house and he knows this. So I decide I'll just meet up with him and we can get a bus to his place. I call and call and he doesnt answer so I just head over, I sleep at his place 99% of the time anyway. By the time I get outside his place I'm worried because he hasnt responded in over half an hour and we were in the middle of making plans. So I get there and hes in his bedroom alone with a girl friend, that he knows I don't like. I don't like her because the first time he introduced me to her she just brushed me off and barely said hi before turning and walking away. And she just gives off this vibe that she thinks shes hot shit and she is always drunk. My bf apologized for not telling me she was coming to his place. He said that she just wanted to hang out longer, she doesn't go here so they rarely see each other. And he also explained his phone was charging when I'd been calling. I now know they didnt do anything and I'm mad over nothing but I still feel upset and don't know how to get over it.

I met a girl at my old job and I felt like we connected right away. She went on vacation and I transferred to another office in town. When she came back from her vacation she added me on Facebook and started messaging me. We started talking back and forth for a bit to the point where I felt comfortable asking her out. She said yes so we went out for a couple beers and ended up talking for almost 5 hours. I had an amazing time talking with this person, I felt like we really hit it off and picked up right where we left off at work. When we were done I payed the tab and drove her home. The next day I texted her saying I had a great time and wanted to know if we could go out again the following weekend. I didn't hear from her for almost a week (which is understandable, life happens) but when I did hear from her she said she, ""...had a great time too but I am already seeing someone."" I'm a bit confused, but I suppose it's my fault for assuming she was single in the first place. Basically, I would like some advice on how to respond. I do like this person, but I don't want to create an awkward situation. *I've never really been in this situation before and would like to respond respectfully and move on.

I (28/f) have been friends with...let's call her Heidi (32/f)...for about a year. She is from Germany but has been married to an American man for about 5 years. She's absolutely miserable in her marriage but relies on her husband financially and also to stay here in the US. He's a strange guy but I like him and don't want to see him hurt. Heidi recently met a man who she is smitten with and has started up an affair with him. She has been using me as a ""cover up"" and tells her husband she is out with me when she is really out with the new guy. Her husband doesn't think twice because I'm a nice girl and he really trusts me. I can certainly see both sides of the story here since I've been in miserable relationships, though I prefer being honest with your partner. I know she can't really leave her husband easily because of her circumstances, but I hate being the person to cover for her. She seems incredibly happy, almost like a different person. I feel that she will be found out and I will end up being a bad guy in all this. She doesn't have a lot of other friends to cover for her either if she carries on with this. Does anyone have any advice for me?

My husband and I (33M and 30F) have an awesome relationship with our downstairs neighbors. Two awesome boys in a single-mom household. Mom is great. My husband and I are sort've ""the cool neighbors"" that offer advice, help with homework, celebrate good grades with pizzas, etc. I pay our neighbor (12M) to take care of my dog before and after school. I travel quite a bit for work, and this arrangement helps us out quite a bit. In short - we have helped build a nice community. Today, my husband took our neighbor (I'll call him J) as his ""son"" to ""Take Your Son to Work Day."" While he introduced J to his group of work associates, J said something like, ""I'm no homo."" The group laughed, but husband was a little taken aback. It kind've embarrassed him. Later in the afternoon, J asked my husband if he was gay. My husband told him no. My husband came home pretty irritated at J because he asked him this question. I think that J was just trying to be ""cool"" in front of a group of grown-ups, but I don't know where the ""are you gay""? question comes in. I feel comfortable talking to J about what happened today, but I was wondering how to bring it up. Husband is planning on taking J with him to a rugby tournament, and I don't want this sort've ""cool putdown"" behavior to continue. I know that this would be better ""man talk"" between J and husband, but I think that J may feel less self-conscious if I talked to him. I am open to any advice - Thanks!

I left with a warm feeling inside me because she told me how cool and nice I am (I don't get completed by girls a lot, especially popular ones {forgot to add, Abby is popular and I'm not}) and we tended to like each other.

My fiancee has struggled in the past with episodes of depression accompanied by weight gain but has always managed to pull through, never really losing the weight but never gaining more than 2 to 5kg and always being focused on fitness and healthy living. I proposed to her a little over a year ago and in the period between our engagement and now, she has had extended periods of depression and gained I would estimate more than 25kg. That is to say that in the 4 years we've been together, she has gone from athletic to heavily built to what would now be clinical obesity. We are supposed to be married in less than 6 months. How do I communicate that her weight gain and extended depressive episodes are affecting everything from my attraction to her to my confidence in her ability to be a reliable mother and life partner? If she can't control her weight now with no stresses in life, what will happen when we have children?

Hello! I'm a transgender woman and I'm kinda sorta smitten with my bisexual friend. He knows about my ""condition"", but what I don't know is how he feels about the whole ""lady with non-standard genital configuration"" thing, in regards to dating. I can't just ask him, either. Saying ""Hey, how do you feel about dating trans women?"" is so blatently obvious that I'd rather be eaten by a lion than say it. We've been friends for a little over five months and I've been crushing on him for about three of those months. He was the first person I came out to, outside my family. He always treats me like a lady, and even corrects people when we're out in public and I get 'sir'ed. Basically, he's gentlemanliness incarnate. I want to be closer to him, but I'm so afraid that telling him about my feelings will make everything super weird if he's not interested. I've never even dated anyone before this, and now I've gone from basic addition to quantum physics! I just want his arms around me, his lips on mine... **ahem*\* So yeah, complicated...

Ok, a little background. My wife and I started dating in college, I was a late bloomer and she's my first real relationship. Things have been good, we of course have had our ups and downs but overall it's been good. We married a little over 3 years ago after dating for 7. Nothing in particular has changed in our relationship but for the past year or so I can't seem to stop thinking about starting over, having a new life on my own terms. I don't feel like I'm unhappy with my wife, I still love her, we still spend most of our time together and have fun, but I can't shake this feeling. I try and push it away but I have these flashes of burning down my current life and starting from scratch. The idea of going it alone used to terrify me, but lately it's starting to sound, well still scary, but in a good way. It makes me feel really bad about myself. I have a wife that loves me, who I love, and we have a good life together. I wish I could figure out what it means. Sometimes I think the fact that it would hurt a person I love dearly is the only reason I haven't done it. So people who have been in long relationships, is this a phase that people go through or is this a symptom of something bigger I just can't see the shape of yet?

I've been dating my boyfriend for almost four years since we were 17. I've never slept with anyone else or had a real relationship besides this one. Everything between us was great the first three years. I knew how much I loved him, and we planned our life together. We spent every day together in high school, and we talked everyday throughout college, and basically lived together this summer in LA working internships. However, this summer before I was abroad, I was full of doubts and still am. The thought of spending my entire life with him without experiencing other things scares me to death. However, a life without him in it is equally scary to me. I communicated these feelings to him last month, and obviously he was very sad, but he hugged me and tried to comfort me--because he knew these feelings were tearing me apart. Now that I'm in London, I've been thinking more of what I want and I'm torn. I'm young and want to do different things, but I love him at the same time. I tried to talk to him last night about taking a break, but he was completely against the idea. It's all or nothing with him. I don't think I could commit to never seeing or talking to him again, but I want to do my own thing here. I don't really know what I want, but some perspective/opinions/personal anecdotes would be greatly appreciated.

So, I've been dating this guy for about 4 months now, the entire relationship has been long distance since the beginning due to different paths having us across the country. He's extremely gungho in the relationship, sends me care packages and texts me daily. I do things for him as well when I'm able to when time permits. We see each other about once a month but are never alone, he's either visiting friends and also visit me. Or work doesn't permit me to see him by myself. We've never had sex either, mostly just foreplay in very odd situations. The other day I finally asked for us to open the relationship, it's something I wanted from the beginning but decided to do a monogamous, long distance relationship. He told me that he expects me to be 100% in or I'm not in at all but that he is okay with the idea of an open relationship. I don't know how to respond to that ultimatum. I like him but I don't know if I really like him enough to continue a relationship with him. This is my first relationship and his second.

My neighbor moved into the apartment adjacent to me a few days ago. Whilst she's a very nice lady, she seems to be very annoyed by my sound levels, as she can apparently hear every word I say through her walls. I'm not a particularly loud person- the noise I produce consists of chatting on Skype and playing soft music to help me sleep. However, no matter how softly I speak, she still hears me. The thing that makes this particularly problematic is my own sleep patterns; I happen to be most active at night, presumably when she's trying to fall asleep. I'm at an impasse because, while I want to continue living in a way that is comfortable to me, I don't want my neighbor to suffer for it. I'm in an LDR, so the Skype chats are dear to me, otherwise I'd cut them out. Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice to give?

Still kind of in shock over this. I just happened to pick up the ipad and see that my husband has been sending emails to his mother telling her that he is going to try his hardest to get her a job at his company, and that they can move into our house. He hasn't told me anything about this. She and his Dad live 2.5 hours away right now, which is, IMO- a perfect distance. We've been going to therapy for other reasons - mainly because he's reneged on our initial after-marriage plans. When we got married, we were planning on moving halfway between both in-laws, but now he dosen't want to. My family lives 6 hours away and I rarely see them and only talk to them once a week, but he told the therapist that I'm too close to them. But now he's secretly trying to get his mom to move down here? Please. It hurts my brain. Also, the cost of living here is really high, so if she DID get the job-- she'd probably be living with us for quite some time, which I am NOT mentally prepared for. And when she did move out, I don't think I can deal with anymore 'drop in' visits to see my son (who is 2.) They already do it enough and they live 2 hours away now. </b>

I have been with him for 3 years now. A few days ago he told me over the phone, just before bed that he is developing feelings for this other girl [22F], let's call her T. He says he still wants to be with me. A bit about T. He got to know T through a group assignment at uni last term and although the assignment is over, they've kept in contact with each other over Facebook, texts and weekly study sessions. Initially the messages were strictly about uni/study but they started exchanging pictures of their pets, a few selfies, liking his profile picture...it grew *friendlier* if you like. When I started getting suspicious and voiced it to him, he made me feel like I was being irrational/paranoid. Eventually it started intruding on my time with my BF. We were out on our anniversary date and he would be messaging her. We would have dinner together and he would send her pictures of his food. Somehow he failed to mention that he had a GF in the entire time they've known each other but I am quite sure neither T nor my BF have done anything physical. After he told me, we agreed that he would stop seeing her and cut down on messaging as well. Meeting him in the last few days was hard because as much as I want to forgive him, I am constantly reminded of what he had done...and I don't think he understands how I am struggling because he continues to make jokes about 'her pussy' (she has a cat). He called it his coping mechanism but I couldn't handle feeling the stress of trying to love somebody who has hurt me. So...I told him that we should take a one week break. Don't contact either T or me. However this morning he messaged me saying he was going to meet up with her tomorrow. He says this is his way of getting over her...but it just causes me more pain and I don't know if I can trust him.

Been dating the same guy for 4.5 years. He lives a little over an hour away. We were really close in the beginning. Over the past two years, there has been a decline. I have addressed this multiple times and he refuses to work on the relationship and sometimes just ignores me. Eventually, it became that every time we saw each other he would mainly play video games. Later, he joined a band. I went to see the band once. No one in the band knew that he had a girlfriend and felt uncomfortable that I was around. I later had to tell them I was the girlfriend to which they replied ,""Sorry, we didn't know he had a girlfriend."" We always had each other's facebook passwords as a form trust. He changed his facebook password and had me walk to the otherside of the room as he typed his info in. I tried to ask him about this and just changed the subject. Over the past two months, he has made no effort to see me. He has never called me. He did not acknowledge Valentine's day or my birthday. There have been a few texts here and there ,but nothing of real substance. About a week ago he sent he a picture of a glass he bought. I said ""cool"" and that was the end of the conversation.

A month ago I met a 24M on Okcupid. We liked each others pictures and hit it off, and so went on the date. The date was... Cringeworthy. First off he was 5'5 at most instead of 5'9 like he said he was. I'm a 5'7 female, not a freakishly tall woman ny any means, but I do look for a man who is at least my hight or taller. I don't think that's unreasonable. I mean, I'm slightly overweight and I don't expect great abs or CQ model looks. But I won't date shorter than me. The guy, lets call him Josh, made me uncomfortable throughout the entire date. He made sexual comments, asked me about my sexual past etc. He played a cheesy song, wrote a crappy poem for me at the restaurant and said he loved me... I was really annoyed with him. When the bill came I planned on splitting it, but he had forgotten his wallet and I ended up paying. He asked me for another date but I told him we weren't compatible and thanked him for the evening. He seemed okay, but then he started texting me, asking if it was because of his height. I told him it wasn't. He sent me an angry message about how I am only a a 6\10 and that women only want 6'5 guys and that he had to lie on dating sites. Honestly yes, his height is a turn off but his behavior is more so. He now texts me about once a day and tries to convince me to 'be friends'. I don't want anything to do with him. What can I do?

I think I need a kick in the pants. A few months ago I started having sex with a (not close at all) friend and everything was good. We were both recently out of relationships and it was fun. I caught the feels and things started going downhill from there. At that point we discussed it and concluded there were feelings on both ends but unsure about starting an actual relationship (he didn't want to, I didn't know). But now it's obvious I like him more and it sucks. When we're together it's good but when we're not it's not good at all. We used to hang out a lot but lately not much at all, due to him. When he doesn't want to, I get upset. Often I hide it but occasionally it bubbles out and I ask him to just tell it like it is if he doesn't like me anymore. It makes me feel insane but I can't seem to help it. After a while, I calm down, but as soon as I think I'm okay, I get sucked right back in. Ironically I've been casually dating another guy about the same amount of time and we're in opposing positions - he likes me more and I'm on the fence. It makes me feel guilty when I'm upset about the first guy and don't have the energy to give the second any attention. Just in case of questions, neither knows about the other, but both know we're not exclusive. I'm not sure what I want out of this or either of them. I wish things were back to earlier in the summer when everything was just for fun, or that I could take a step back emotionally.

So me and my now ex met online July 2013. From the start I knew he was a really disciplined individual because of his eating habits ( very strict; non GMO, only free range meats etc..), his education and his martial arts career. Things were great up until 4 months ago, we would argue all the time about everything. We would have super intense arguments over the stupidest things like me wearing make up (he thought I looked hideous and super fake) or like me talking about something stressful in my life without warning him first that I was going to do that. He restricted my ability to talk about my stress in life to the weekends because he ""couldn't handle my emotions all the time"" and when it came down to discussing my stress or an argument, he would dissect every emotion to action to reaction to emotion. I just couldn't do that anymore, even after letting him know all I wanted him to do is just to listen, not to analyze in explicit detail everything I was feeling and my actions because of those feelings. I even went to counseling for the last 3 weeks because he said my communication is poor and I don't understand the English Language ( even though it is my first language). I was just going to counseling by myself. He never offered to come along with me. So I broke up with him yesterday, and it wasn't until I said "" I realized through the counseling that I am just done trying to make us work"" was he then willing to commit and go to counseling and ""Do whatever it takes to keep you here with me"" I didn't give in to that because I feel like if he really did want to make us work, he would have been that committed since the beginning of our problems. But now I feel really guilty. I feel like I should have given him that opportunity. I don't know if it's just a post break up feeling or if I genuinely made a huge mistake.

My gf and I have been dating for about a year and 4 months. We have had a good relationship with only a few hiccups, she is my first gf and I am her first bf. Lately I have been hitting the gym with my friend and I have grown close to him and is now my best friend. In recent time we have been talking about masturbation, she has been comfortable about talking about it with me. She was very upset that I watched porn but she would let me, that same day I found out through another friend that she masturbated to the thought of my best friend which in result really angered me and hurt in a way. I thought I was over reacting but I can't seem to get over it. When I asked if it was true she said it was true and I cussed at her through text and told her to leave me alone, because I just was really upset because he is my best friend. After this I texted her and we were back to normal but then we started to sext and the thought of what happened haunts me and now I can't bare the thought of her. So I told her that I needed space to think and to leave alone for a while, I said this politely and she understood. Now she called me and left a voicemail because I was busy and she said that she was bad at giving me space and was hoping to hear my voice, but that she will leave me alone until I text or call her.

I come visit her every chance I get and I feel like we're really compatible. How would I take this to the next level? I get thoughts of wanting to propose to her, but that would require her to leave her entire life, friends, career future and family away to move in with me. I feel like that's a lot to ask for, but is it? I'm not sure.. I've already brushed indirectly about the subject, asking if she'd want to stay where she is. She said she definitely would want to leave her country, but again, I feel like I'd feel better if I got to know that she's willing to do it because she thinks is right rather than do it because I asked her out of love.

[Original post. ]( We had breakfast a week later and talked about everything, the house and whatnot, and he said he is working on it and he feels awful about it and doesn't want to lose me and he missed me a lot this week. He said his goal is to be in there by the end of the month and I reiterated that I am willing to help in any way I can, and gave some specific examples of how I would be willing to help. As of Friday, he is living in his house full-time. He made a good point about how my eagerness to ""start our life together"" made him feel like I didn't like or appreciate what we have now, which I understand in a way. I had to explain that it wasn't that, it was that I love what we have now so much that I want MORE. i want to transition to more. I think he got that. We continued it into dinner and he kept mentioning THE PLAN (""the plan"" being a plan for our future/to propose) again and i was like WHAT IS THE PLAN and he said he couldn't tell me, so I asked for a timeframe at least, and he said he plans to propose by the end of the year (!!!!). I asked him to please tell my PARENTS the plan so they will stop asking me or saying OH MAYBE HE'LL PROPOSE on any holiday or special occasion and making me anxious. Then we had really, really good sex.

Not sure how useful it is to post this here but here goes. I am usually pretty critical about art in general. I'm excited when people are into it but it's really difficult when someone says they do art, you date them then they link you to their deviantart and it's all really really amateur sketches of anime characters. What do I do at this point when I am really critical about this particular stereotype regarding 'hobbyist artists' who turn out to.....not be any good? I can't just go on lying saying their art is good when my standards are pretty high at this point. Been doing this stuff over 10 years. Visual art is something 'anyone' can do, so the quality of it varies a lot. Am I being an asshole or can someone actually give me good advice on how to overcome this? Am I supposed to say 'yeah it's good' then turn around to my other art friends and defend how good it is later? It's not like I'm dating a med student and telling her I'm a doctor in my spare time...

Hello, Recently things have gotten more serious with my gf who is 32 and has a daughter and myself who is 29 and has no kids. She broke up with her ex somewhat recently, maybe 6 months ago or so. Her ex constantly calls to talk to her daughter (nearly nightly) and watches her probably one or two nights a week, and hangs out with her for probably every other weekend (for the whole weekend). When we first started hanging out I didn't really care, but now that she wants to be more serious it's starting to seem very strange to say the least. I brought it up a tiny bit by saying I understand that you dated him for like 3 years but doesn't he want his own children and family someday? What if you moved across the country? He's not the dad. I know it would be hard to let go of a child, but for his sake and the little girls sake I wonder what's right. The conversation didn't really go anywhere and she just said if he wants to see her she isn't going to say no. I tried to let it go but now this week he is taking her daughter for a week and a half camping trip. This just seems wrong to me, and it seems like most men she dates in the future would question it and most women her ex dates would wonder why he is always with her ex's daughter. I feel like there's something nefarious behind this, and maybe one or the other is trying to keep hooks in the other through the child. It seems so strange to me, am I being crazy?

My friend (Mary) was Face timing with her boyfriend (Joe) and started to ask him about what he dislikes about her. Joe mentions that he doesn't really like Mary's small chest and dislikes her bony hands. (She's really skinny). Of course, Mary is hurt by this and I'm not sure how to judge Joe. He has consistently shown signs of immaturity but he seems to care for her well being. I understand that people have preferences and all but how should a person react to this kind of confession? Does he genuinely love her if he finds these physical qualities about her a bit unappealing?

Okay, I've been friends with this girl for about 10 months. I first met her at college about a year ago. She had a boyfriend at first, but eventually she broke up with him, and started to pay more attention to me. Soon, we went out several times, started to text a lot, etc. She made it seem like she wanted me to be her boyfriend by how she acted, but when school was over and we went back home (we live relatively close) she acted like she didn't have time to hang out. Eventually she told me she was going out with this other guy, whom she actually did make her boyfriend. I was pretty devastated, and I realized I had been friendzoned. We still text constantly. Anyway, she's been dating him for a couple months and she mentions how she's having trouble trusting him, because he's going to NYC this weekend and some hot friend of his will be there. Oh yeah, and she mentioned that he told her that he has cheated on his girlfriends before, but he would *never* do it again. I just want to ask her what the fuck she is thinking, but I don't want to come off as a dick, and I don't want to ruin my future chances by giving her a piece of my mind. I'm obsessing over this; I really like her a lot, and I care about her, but I really don't understand what's going through her head. Any advice?

My GF lost her job 3 weeks ago today. As of this point, to the best of my knowledge, she has only submitted a single resume to a potential employer, despite being home all the time. She didn't even file for her unemployment benefits until Saturday, 19 days after she was let go. I can afford the rent if she were to be unemployed, but things would be stretched far too thin for me to have any kind of flexibility or free time, as I would be putting in extra overtime. The fact that she is so seemingly unmotivated to find a job really bothers me, and I don't want to have to support both of us as a young adult who is still establishing his career. The relationship was somewhat strained before all this happened, but now it is getting to be so much that I am 50/50 on whether or not to continue. If I were to end things, she wouldn't really have a guaranteed place to go - her parents live locally, but her father moved into her room when she moved out, and she would hate to move back in with them anyway, due to major differences in ideals. So, I'm not sure what I should do. She's not helping herself, and is showing zero initiative in taking her own future under control. She stays at home watching anime and playing WoW. She hasn't taken on any additional chores at the house despite having 50 hours of extra free time a week. What do you guys think?

So my wife and I have been married for two months and we just got our first look at our wedding photos. She hates them. My wife feels like there are a ton of photos of my family and hardly any of her's, in truth our photographer did appear to focus on my family. In addition, she felt like a lot of the pictures didn't look as ""professional"" as she was expecting (i.e., bad lighting, our stances look forced, bad positioning of flowers and whatnot, very few photos of guest and other family, pictures of the photographers daughters at the wedding mixed with the wedding party, etc.). The photographer in question is someone we know through our church. My father is also the pastor of said church so bringing up our displeasure would cause a lot of drama we would prefer to avoid, if possible. If necessary we will talk to our photographer like adults, but, in my experience, being a pastor's son can make it difficult to keep my issues centered on me and not somehow transferred onto my dad. That was a long way of saying I'm looking for a solution where I can do something special for my wife and keep it between us and family. My wife has a, ""I don't want to talk about it because there is nothing to do about it"" mentality right now. Even now she is in a bit of a quiet rage at the other end of out couch. I'm looking for a possible solution of something I could do that would help ease her anger and, hopefully, make up for some of the bad photos. Obviously I can't go back in time and getting all that family together again would be incredibly difficult but I'm willing to hear all advise and ideas. Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any ideas of what I can do to help make this better?

Background: Him and I have been together for about 1 year and a half. He's only given me a reason to doubt him once, and I can't actually blame him for it because we were not technically together. That's whole other story. Now, it's not that I don't care if he looks at porn, because I do care. I feel jealous and insecure. Yet, I don't forbid him from doing it. I won't even be upset if he does, just secretly jealous. So, I've never told him that he can't look at porn. To me, it sounds like ""lame girlfriend taking away all my fun"". He's told me repeatedly that he doesn't look at porn because he no longer feels the need to. When I even offered to look at porn with him, he refused and said he would much rather just have sex with me. So that's why I'm so darn confused about finding porn on his tablet that he claims isn't his. ...Is he lying? I honestly don't know. He's never lied to me before. No one comes over to our apartment, so it's not like he had a horny friend over mess with his tablet. He doesn't take it anywhere so that someone could have put it on his tablet. I mean I found like 10 pictures downloaded to his gallery. How does that happen accidentally? Do ghosts download porn to tablets or something? (just kidding) Am I being naive to believe him or is this really just weird? Does porn sometimes show up on your computers/tablets randomly? Please don't be mean, I feel really dumb even asking this.

Sorry in advance for typos, on my phone. I'm gonna start off by saying that I just broke up with my boyfriend of a year about 6 weeks ago, an just prior to that had been in a 3 year LTR with my first boyfriend. So, recently single. So this guy, we'll call him R, works with me. About a month ago we started hanging out outside of work. I was a little interested in him at first, not taking it too seriously. Then the second time we hung out he kissed me. I was caught off guard, but found myself even more interested in him after that. We hung out a couple more times, made out, hand holding etc, so a couple weeks later I felt like I was developing feelings for him. Then last night we go out and get super drunk... I end up staying over and we had sex, which was good... But then I'm drunkenly talking to him and tell him ""I kinda like you."" his response was ""i have a lot of fun with you"" but ""we haven't hung out that much."" I feel frustrated that he uses us not hanging out much as a reason not to like me because he is the one who started the whole thing right away by kissing me. Now im just super nervous around him and a little depressed now because I feel like I was just friend zoned by a guy after having sex with him. Basically I feel really shitty about myself and really regretting last night. What do you guys think I should do? Is there any chance of him actually liking me or was this pretty much it?

Me (22 F), him (22 M), duration of 1.5 years I've been in 3 relationships, all of which were long-term. I've been to one doctor whom prescribed me Citalopram for depression, for context. No matter how ""happy"" I tell myself I am in each relationship, I feel miserable and I want to drive them away. I know that I have ambivalent-avoidant personality traits due to past traumas but as I've developed I've only gotten worse with interpersonal relationships, including romantic. I don't believe I'm happy and thus I can't be happy in a relationship, and I understand that. But I'm also supposed to try and be optimistic right? So I try relationships and stick to them for the long-haul and now I've got a guy I'd say marriage is a possibility. But I think my traits, past and ""commitment-phobeness"" is keeping me from enjoying any part of this process. I've opened up to him and how I'm feeling but some things he says is quite controversial and can send me into a spiral of confusion, hate, sadness, etc. The point of this post is to ask if there are any alternative ways to feeling happier in relationships when you don't like associating with people inherently but are trying to, and have been trying to for a long time.

I am a 39 divorced woman, and have tried online dating. Have some OK dates, plenty of bad messages, and of course some from men overseas, specifically India. I am American, but look Indian, maybe one reason i get these messages. And of course just foreign men wanting to correspond with American women. I have Indian friends IRL, so I am familiar with the culture. I don't usually reply to these messages but there was one that caught my attention so I did, and it's been great. The man's name is ""Sunny"", he is a doctor in India. We started talking and he is just awesome. We talk about everything. We share the same values. His family doesnt believe in the caste system so that is not an issue. We starting off with messages on WhatsApp and now use IMO video chat, so I know what he looks like in real life. On IMO I have also seen his workplace, talked to his very nice colleagues who are pretty funny, his friends when they are out, talked to his sister, seen his apartment, his city, so I am pretty sure he is who he says he is. We have been talking/video chatting daily for 3 months. We have actually talked about marriage. The plan is he comes on a tourist visa, we see if we hit it off IRL, and if we do, he returns to India and we apply for a fiance visa. We both understand this is a long and hard process. I cannot travel to India for personal reasons. I had him talk to my Indian friends and they think he is nice and apparently he comes from a good family name they know. The only thing that gives me pause is the whole online long distance dating thing. Can this really work? Has anyone been through this/ know someone who has? Did it work out? Advice please.

We've been dating for well over a year and recently signed a lease together. He makes me happy, and we have fun together, but I have nagging doubts. I'm very ambitious, working on my Masters while working full time as a software engineer, and always thought I'd be with someone similar. Although he has a stable job, working with intellectually disabled adults (he's great at it and loves it), he doesn't have any savings to speak of, and I recently had to loan him $2400 (his share of first/last/security) when we signed the lease (honestly, I doubt I'll get paid back for a while...) He's a nice guy, loves me, and means well, but his lack of motivation and personal responsibility (doesn't take great care of himself, gets delivery food a lot, plays WoW 4 nights a week...) makes it really difficult for me to respect him as a person, and I find myself getting increasingly angry at him about it as we get more ""committed."" Sometimes he'll ""improve"" for a while: I drag him to the gym, I make travel plans, I'll push us to go out and try new things, he says he's quitting the WoW guild soon... I just hate being the one doing all the pushing, and it's exhausting. He's extremely intelligent -- he does NYTimes crosswords in half an hour every day, knows tons of stuff, and beats me easily at every game we play... I feel like I just have to either get over myself, or get over him. I can't decide if I should marry him because I'm happy with him and he'd make a great father (we both want children in ~5 years, and have talked about it), or if I should leave him because I can't respect him and I won't have as fulfilling of a life with him as I might with someone else.

Me 21M, roommate 21M and his SO (21F, also roommate). Rent is/was split between him and I, with his SO helping with groceries (part time job). On one hand, it's a good thing. His job sucked (warehouse) and was bringing on depression, a drop in schoolwork and hurting his relationship. He's feeling much better in the three days since he was let go. That is the other positive, officially, he ""resigned"". On the downside, even with me working full time, I have personal bills (car loan). There is no way we can make rent with the SO only working 20 odd hr a week at minimum wage. We have roughly 2 months using his extra financial aid to help with rent and utilities. So there is some breathing room. He's a hard worker, already started job applications and I put in a word at my job. I'm trying to be supportive but firm that he keeps on applying.

I love my wife ... I think. I honestly couldn't tell you anymore if I do or not. I know I love my family and my life and sometimes that's enough but sometimes it isn't . First I am not sure if I really want to leave her or not . When we are fighting It is sometimes all I can think about but I am angry and I try not to make decisions when I am angry. Then when everything is going alright I weigh the pros and cons of leaving and I always end up settling on staying but very rarely because I love my wife . I don't like the idea of not being a dad everyday. We have two children ages [10 f] and [5 m] and I love being with them everyday so I don't Know if I could handle being an every other weekend dad ( not that there is anything wrong with that). Joint custody would be great but I think would be very hard to get my Wife to agree to. Also financially it is terrifying I already don't make a huge amount of money so adding child support onto that I would be able to afford an efficiency apartment and that's about it. I also have absolutely no support I am estranged from my family for reasons to long to get into here but even if i wasn't I am the most well off of any of them so they simply wouldn't be able to afford to help. lastly I am not even sure if leaving is really what I want. Yes, when things are bad they are VERY bad, not physical but definitely my own personal version of hell. However when things are good the are OK not great but after almost 12 years OK is all I ask. I don't want to leave just to find out that being alone or with someone else isn't what I want either. I am just kind of lost

Reddit, this is becoming a problem. Just got out of my first relationship, after a series of random hookups. None of the guys before my current SO (we still kinda see each other casually) had anything in common except they were all musicians of some kind or shared my music taste. The problem is, I can only find myself being attracted to guys into my extremely obscure likings (shoegazing/psychedelic/lo-fi/space rock music are my favorites...) Now I'm just at a loss because I've realized this is something I can't help, since it's such a huge part of my life (I work at a radio station and would like to organize musical events in the future) but it's making my life a lot harder to deal with since ""no one compares"" to my taste (or my Ex/SO's). I really have no idea what to do about this because all experiences I've had with people who have not shared this part of my interest have been emotionally disappointing, and just devoid of any relevance whatsoever. Af the same time, I wish this wasn't such a big deal, but I know no way around it, since physical relationships with people I have nothing in common with just don't satisfy me either. Heeeeelp!

We all met in college. They've been dating since then and we're all part of the same tight knit group of friends. Recently they broke up, and my friend Julia has been very hush hush about what happened. I've been trying to reach out for weeks, see if she needs a shoulder to lean on, girls night out, etc. She has been dodging my texts, and until very recently, I had no idea why. One of our mutual friends (closer to Cam, the ex bf) told me Julia broke up with Cam because he apparently has a thing for me? This is news to me. Cam has always been fairly quiet, levelheaded, etc. So for him to all of a sudden come out with news that he has feelings for his girlfriend's close friend, is a little ridiculous and unbelievable. Apparently he said my name during sex ... and then Julia (rightfully) grilled him on it until he broke down and confessed. Never once has he made it seem like he's into me. In any case I'm worried Julia might think something happened between Cam and I. The thing is, I had a crush on him in college (before they got together) which she knew about. So maybe in her mind, she thinks I'm responsible for this? I don't know. Her friendship is important to me. I get that she needs space and might even resent me without meaning to, but ignoring me isn't going to fix anything either. It's been almost a month.

My family threw one and today, my groom's family is throwing one. My family refuses to come (all 25 of them as I have a large family) because of Ramadaan. However, they will attend birthdays and other celebrations without any issues. They say they ""support"" this marriage, but they have made this wedding process hell for me. They cause a fight over any little reason, often berate me for torturing them by marrying outside Islam, and gossip about me constantly amongst each other. We have a month left before the wedding, no other date worked this month since they have events planned for themselves every weekend, and they are refusing to attend this event. I feel so embarrassed not to have even a single member of my family supporting me at today's event. I want to tell them to not attend the wedding, but I don't know how to - am I being too dramatic?

We've been friends for 2 years and I fell for him. We have very intimate relationship (i.e. we talk about very personal things a lot). Last year I told him I fell in love with him and don't wish to continue our friendship on that account. He was really devastated and confused and said my infatuation is probably cause by the fact I have a small social cirlce and he also said he's supposed to go on a date with some girl, so... Anyway, he asked me to stay friends with him and said, ""I don't want to ever cut contact with you"". So we stayed friends and for some time it was okay.

We've been dating for 5 months so far, and I'm definitely serious about her and I. Right now, we're extremely happy with each other and I told her that I loved her last week. Everything is great right now. Unfortunately, we won't be together for Christmas break, but we'll FaceTime each other and call regularly. I've read posts about high school sweet hearts trying to take a relationship into college before, almost everything that I've read has resulted in a break up. I know that if her and I go down this road, I'll be devastated in the end. Second semester is going to fly by, and before we know it, we'll be going to prom. I know I should live in the moment here, and I've been trying to go along the lines of that, but I do want to start forming some kind of plan. I should also mention that we're not going to the same college. She might go out of state, I'm going to community college for financial reasons, and she's getting accepted into four year universities. It would be a LDR. I love this girl, and I'm willing to compromise to stay with her. Anyway, my question is: What should we do? Should I try to maintain a LDR with her? I'm hoping for suggestions or stories of your own I guess. I know I'm jumping way ahead of myself with thoughts like this but I just want an opinion different than my own.

Hi, y'all. My cousin and I were close once but she started demanding way too much from me and gets upset whenever I don't do what she wants. After spending a lot of time here, I realize she's a narcissist and so is her mom. It's always about her and what she wants. Never any consideration for my feelings. Anyway, I was supposed to do day after Christmas shopping with her; picking her up and we drive around to different shops. She insisted on smoking in my brand new car that I just got in October. I told her I'd prefer not since I want to keep that as a nonsmoking car, whether if it's cigarettes or pot. Plus she has a tendency to drop the blunt, she burned a hole in my other car which is why I didn't want to smoke in the car at all. She wouldn't let it go even though I said she could smoke before we left, so that made me not want to go shopping with her. She texted me this Christmas Eve asking if we were still going and I said probably not since I wasn't feeling well, headache and the runs. Never heard back from her to this day. Last year wasn't fun because she rushed me telling me we had to leave because she's done at this store and kept telling me to stop buying so much because we wouldn't have enough room. Yea, while her cart was full and I was carrying a shopping basket. So since then I did a slow fade and I've noticed every time we see each other in person, she always says **""you never text me anymore"", ""I'm mad at you"", etc.** My first response is to say ""phone works both ways."" But that sounds smart-assed. I end up shrugging my shoulders and say I'm busy with school, which is true. We're having a birthday party tomorrow for my aunt, cousins mom and my cousin will be there and I KNOW she will say the same fucking thing again... So what is a good response without being a bitch about it?

So I'm dating this lovely woman. Stupidly I didn't set up any boundaries regarding my intentions only being casual dating prior to meeting. We have now been on 5 dates give or take and each one has gone well. I have Spoken to her regarding my continued use of dating apps but haven't firmly communicated boundaries, which is stupid I realise. It's now getting to the point where I feel the exclusivity question is fast approaching and she appears to be planning our future together but I'm not feeling it! She has proven herself to be an amazing lady, and is beginning to confide things in me (eg. About previous heart breaks and about how this is really unusual for her to date). I really don't want to mislead her or cause her any hurt. I'm just finding it really hard to find the right wording that lets her know that she really is the nicest girl I've ever met but I just can't plan a future with her. Unfortunately the reasons why I don't wish to continue are fickle, shallow and in fact a bit silly so I feel like I can't tell her them without hurting her.

We've been in a relationship for almost 5 years now and marriage is definitely in our future, but every few months we have a slight problem. She gets really paranoid about the slightest health quirk. She'll have a headache when she wakes up and within a few hours it progresses into her being convinced she has cancer. And of course she stresses out and that only prolongs the headache and that becomes 'proof' that she has a tumor or something in hear head. Vicious cycle. She has a history of displaying OCD-like tendencies when she was in her teens (doctor-confirmed, not the stupid 'I cleaned my room lulzocd') and has anxiety issues in general. She was on anxiety meds for a while and by her own admission it helped her not take the headaches or bug bites or whatever as seriously and to the next level like she was before. But financial issues and her owing the doctor's office money has kept her form being able to return and get a new prescription. It just happens every month or two and for a week she's an anxious, stressed out mess convinced that she's dying. And she never does, but she never seems to remember that and she never acknowledges it when I remind her. I love her death and will put up with this til the end of our days, but any way I can make this easier on us both would be much appreciated. I think part of the problem is that I don't know how to deal with it, so i'm not dealing with it very well at all. I want to be supportive, but not too supportive. I want to be stern and remind her it's in her head, but I don't want her to feel like no one has her back. What do I do?

So we started going out when I was 15-16, and lasted about 2 years. During that time we fought *a lot*, constantly broke-up made-up and she cheated on me several times with her ex. When I learned that she cheated I ended the relationship. 2 years after that (in college) we were both in relationships with different people. Both relationships were very stable, no cheating, no lying, no fighting. Now we are both single and still attracted to each other, we´ve talked about going out again, but I'm not sure if it is the correct thing to do. I know that we were both in very bad places 6 years ago, definitely not emotionally mature enough for a relationship. I was a terrible boyfriend, very shy, not a gentleman and I rejected all her sexual advances because I was too nervous. I also wanted to kill myself. Now I'm a completely different person and from what I've seen she's also changed a lot. I'm sure that a relationship with her now will be very different from what it was before but I'm not sure if I should forgive her for cheating?? Thanks!!

I have been friends with the husband [34m] for a while. A few years ago he met his now wife [34f] and we have always got along pretty well. Recently when the wife has been drunk at parties she starts to hit on me and tell people that im her other boyfriend. She will cuddle with me and get a little handsy. The first time this happened her husband saw I was a little uncomfortable and told me it was fine and to just go with it. The most recent time she made out with me and I over heard her telling other people that she wanted a MMF threesome. Outside of these parties we never talk about these occurances and I just never bring it up. Im not sure how to handle it though. I wouldnt be adverse to engaging in something more physical but I also dont want to hurt the friendship by overstepping any boundaries.

We lost her yesterday. She had numerous health problems, the primary one being progressive epilepsy. She was in the hospital a month or so ago and we thought we might lose her, but she made a near full recovery and was basically back to normal until I got a call from my grandmother yesterday morning saying she had passed in the night. I've never really dealt with an unexpected loss like this. I've only lost grandparents when I was a child. I think I'm still in shock and it hasn't fully sunk in. I got the news when I was out with my girlfriend visiting the planetarium. I haven't cried or anything and I can tell she (my gf) thinks it's weird that I haven't shown much emotion regarding the issue. I mainly can't stop thinking about the three children she left behind. Their father is abusive and now they're left with no mother. I know I need to step up and be a bigger part of their lives. I personally hate sob stories and I'm not looking for sympathy. That's actually an aspect that I'd like advice on. I'm the type of person to bottle things and not mention them to anyone because I hate feeling like people feel sorry for me. I absolutely hate it. I haven't told anyone other than my girlfriend who was there when I got the news. I went to work as usual because I'm in a new city by myself and my girlfriend went back home an hour away this morning so I'd just be sitting at home by myself. I'm going to let my boss know here in a bit, but I just absolutely hate talking about this sort of thing. I'm really hoping they don't all sign a card for me or something like that.. I don't want everyone asking about it. My family is more dysfunctional than average, always fighting and being dramatic over stupid things, and I know when I go back home for the funeral it's going to be complete chaos with family members who haven't spoken due to drama seeing each other for the first time in years. I'm dreading it. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? How long does it take for this kind of thing to fully sink in? How did you cope?

So my girlfriend ""Kyla"" and I have been together for about a year now. Our relationship has been great from the start, we always got along super well and had the best of times together. I often tell her she is me in a different body -- we complete each others' sentences and are very affectionate and in love. The sex is great, she's my best friend, everything's awesome. Or it had been, for the past 11 months or so. Around a month ago I felt that we kind of reached a rough patch. We were fighting over silly things (well, not really fighting, more like having talks about it), one little thing she said would make me mad and vice versa. We always apologized and made up before going to sleep, but we still argued quite a bit. I'm not sure what to do. Lately I've found myself wondering if I'd be happier if I was single. I love Kyla and she's my life, but there are days when I look at her and think that I'm not really that attracted to her anymore. And then that thought leaves just as fast as it came. So we have our great days, days where I'm head over heels for her, and then we have our off days, when I start to question why we're still together and if we should break up. I'm not sure if this is because the honeymoon phase is finally over or what, but I don't want to give up on our relationship. I love this girl. I could see myself long-term with her, buying a house and getting a dog and everything. What can I do to make our relationship go back to what it was? Is there any hope? If I work at it, can I make these little fights stop or is it hopeless? Any advice would be really appreciated. I'm kind of at a loss right now, she's the first person I've ever fallen in love with and I want to work through this rough patch really badly. Thank you.

So I have dated this girl for 4 months. She has been really great so far, we fight minimally and get a long great. So unfortunately she had to work for NYE, and my friends wanted me to go out with them to a fancy dinner, then to a house party, then to the casino, and then they had a hotel room at the casino we could crash at so no one would drink and drive. The SO really wanted to come but she couldn't get off work. I told her I would send her pic updates through out the night. I sent a selfie on the way to the restaurant and then I proceeded to get way too drunk. I only sent the one picture and the rest of the night was a blur, i missed several calls and finally answered her texts at 2 in the morning. Not my finest moment and I admit that I wasn't the worlds best boyfriend. But I have been faithful the entire relationship. Now she is not talking to me, she got drunk and high last night, which is out of character, then said the texts were sent from someone else on her phone, and I'm really at a loss of words. Maybe she thinks I was cheating? Maybe she was looking for an out in the relationship and took this opportunity? Her past boyfriends have all been pretty scummy and I have a job and am independent. I really don't know. I suppose I'm just looking for another set of eyes, to help me understand that aren't related to me, as all my family has loved her and I don't want them thinking differently of her. Feel free to ask questions.

Try to make this as short as possible. I'm [27f] he is [29m]. been together over 3 years. Have fun together, travel the world together, keep our own apartments and no plans of marriage. Seemingly a great deal. I love him for reasons I try to write down and only found shallow reasons and because he is a good travel companion. Lame. He has a short temper and screams at me, calls me his ""cancer"", laughs at me when I cry, goes away for weeks for work and makes no attempt to even check on me. Whenever I tell him I don't think he cares about me he just gets frustrated and tells me if I keep saying that then he won't care at all. Recently found messages to a friend he has who is a girl about wanting to meet up in another state. When we were out of the country on vacation he tells her he is with his other family. All of these things should be enough to end it even as I write. I just can't get the strength to let it go after so many good memories of being together. Stupid shit like cuddling, wrestling, making dinner together, seeing beautiful places in the world together. I believe in monogamy and am feeling like the only one in the world these days who does. Losing my faith in marriage, and in my ability to detect when things are fishy. Sorry guys, this turned into a rant to the internet because I am too private to tell our friends about it. I don't care if you guys are harsh, obviously I am used to the intense talk. I used to be so fun, I am a successful young woman with strong morals. Just gotta get my shit together and figure out how to end this. Wish I could just disconnect my heart from my head...how can I break up with him without telling him I went through his phone, I don't want to have him explode on me and end this three year relationship in a way that would make me regret everything??

My cousin, who is 17 now, met his girlfriend and started dating a little over a year ago. Last week while out to dinner with their parents, his girlfriend's mom said to her daughter ""Isn't it funny how our little plan worked?"" My aunt is like ""...uh what plan?"". Well apparently this girl's mother saw a picture of my cousin on facebook playing sports and on the homecoming court. Since her daughter was going to be a new student at the same school as my cousin, she told her to find him on the first day of school and ""make him your boyfriend"". At that point, my cousin had never had a girlfriend or gotten much attention from girls then all of a sudden he had this cute blond cheerleader following him around. So obviously, he was hyped. When I was told this story, I wanted to find this woman and wring her neck. Especially now that my cousin is completely wrapped around his girlfriend's finger, not going to the college he got a FULL RIDE SCHOLARSHIP to so he can stay home with her and talking about moving into her parent's house with her. I guess I just needed to rant, I doubt there's anything to be done. I just feel like I'm watching a bad movie.

On January 20, my husband of 6 years was diagnosed with brain cancer. We have a son together, and I have two daughters that live with me from my previous marriage. My ex husband sees them maybe twice per year. He lives on the east coast, me on the west (relevant). Attempting to make this brief. I'm just very confused and want to know if I'm reading to much into this. Yesterday, after finding out about my husband's diagnosis, he texts me and says he is making a trip to see our daughters and while he is here, he would like to take me, and my husband out to dinner. Ummmm..wat. While the gesture appears innocent and friendly, this is outside of his nature. He had ALWAYS been a total jerk to my husband. To the point of thoughts of filling restraining orders against him. My questions are two. One, why would he offer this and why the sudden change of heart? And two, how can I politely decline. He's being insistent, even after I've said no several times. There is a lot of back story absent here, so if I can answer questions to clarify, I'm happy to. I'm just a flood of emotions that I cannot separate right now.

I currently go to a community college and I am very happy here. I have the opportunity to go to nursing school here and get my ASN and even my BSN by taking a few summer and online courses. I do have to option to switch schools and just get my bachelors there. Regardless I do need my bachelors. At the community college it could range from a semester shorter or a semester longer than going to another school and just getting my bachelors. My mom keeps acting like I will be done with school much faster if I go to a different one. I really do not want to leave the school I am at. My parents want me to have a big college experience, but I am an nursing major. I need to focus on my classes and going through the hassle of moving schools and learning a new town would be a something I do not want to deal with. It would also involve me being an hour away from my girlfriend (1 year together) [F 18] and would create more stress. I am not worried about my relationship being an issue if I switched school's and we have discussed this often together and are willing to pull through it. What I am upset about is that I do not have an option of where I go. My parents frequently talk about what they are going to do when I am gone and out of the house. I understand it sucks having me around constantly, but I would feel much better of staying in a place I am happy at. I have tried telling them that I want to stay here but they keep saying that I just want to go to my current school because my girlfriend is there. They cannot get past this in their heads. They do not just understand that I want to stay here because I like it and I do not see the point in changing. How can I get them to understand and get the whole girlfriend thing out of their heads?

I recently became married (about mid January) to an amazing man, who just so happens to be a single dad. We've been dating for around 6 years, so I've known his kids from when they were younger. We never really spent much time together (the kids and I), every time I came over they would both go up in their rooms or just flat out ignore me. We had plans to move in about a year ago, before marriage, but I had delayed it so I could take care of my sick mother for awhile longer. So I officially moved in on the night of our wedding, and it seems like from then all hell has broken loose in our relationship. His youngest (16) is very highly sensitive and emotional, and she always LOVES to remind me that I'm ""not her mother"" (which I'm aware of), and always gives me attitude for even the most simple request. His oldest (19) is the exact same way, although not as emotional or hesitant about it. She has straight up called me a bitch and many other names to my face before, that I have ignored for the sake of keeping the peace. The problem is, last night husband and I got into a big argument. Younger sister told her dad that I am ""mean"" to her, and I'm trying to hard to get close to her (confused on what she means by that) My husband is very attached to his kids, and that's something that I admired about him, but I really wish he would hear me out too instead of always instantly jumping to their defense. Things like this have been happening almost all the time since January, and even though it's only been 4 months since I've been here, I feel myself already starting to become tired. Like I'm walking on eggshells constantly. He completely shuts down whenever I try to have a conversation about them to him. I don't want our relationship to end over something so simple, but I don't have any other way of reaching him. Their mother is deceased just for reference.

Here's a bit of context for y'all: We both met freshmen year in our school's theatre program. At the end of freshman year, I transferred to an early college program, however we were still friends. It was obvious we both had feelings for one another, but we eventually fell out of communication. Flash forward to 2016, and after making several ""why am I single I'm cute"" tweets (real mature I know), this guy DMs me on Twitter confessing he had a crush on me sophomore year and asking if I wanted to catch up with him sometime. Of course, I said yes, and on our fourth date this past weekend, we ended up kissing and confessing feelings for one another blah blah blah sappy shit. After this I was almost certain things were going to get more serious, however the very next day he wants to meet me and tell me that he doesn't want to get involved romantically with me because he's going to university in the fall, which is 40 mins-1 hr away, and I have to stay one more year in high school (graduation requirement, long story). As you can imagine, I'm crushed. We have several months before he has to move, I don't see why we can't cherish these few months then decide what to do when the time comes. I really, really want to be with this guy, and part of me wants to convince him to at least try it out for a while, but part of me also knows it's futile. Can any of you help me decide what to do? I guess I can't empathize with his worrying about how college will change him because I've technically been in college since I was 15 and I haven't experienced that whole ""college life"" thing everyone talks about. sorry if this is incoherent, I have a learning disability and it's hard for me to express my thoughts properly.

My mum is currently stuck in an unhappy marriage with my father, and had been thinking about divorce since I was about 4 years old (so for 15 years). The situation has been drawn out so long, and it's a bit complicated, so unless you need to know the details I won't go too much into the whole marriage thing. But my mum, as some form of crutch, drinks heavily almost every night. Both my parents are fond of their drink anyway, so it took me a long time to notice - until my more observant sister brought it to my attention. Now I can't stop thinking about it; pretty much every evening she drinks almost a whole bottle of red wine (my dad will maybe have 2 glasses) and will become almost unintelligible through her slurring, and I'll hear her stumbling up the stairs to her bedroom when I'm in bed. I always want to try and bond with her; watch a film or a tv show with her, but it's like I have a time limit before she becomes so intoxicated that it's pointless and I just find it infuriating. I've tried talking to her about it, but she only seems apologetic about it *when* she's drunk (she will cry and says she knows she should stop and that she's sorry) but when she is sober, she just seems to find my concern amusing. I've tried hiding bottles, pouring small amounts down the drain (we aren't the most well off so I feel reluctant to do that). I've tried talking to my dad but he just brushes it off as not being his problem. She even drank my whole bottle malibu I got for a birthday present without asking. I just don't know what to do any more. My mum makes *me* feel guilty for getting on at her because she already feels shit having to stay with my dad (for now).

Okay so this isn't as bad as I'm making it out to be probably. But on the first date, he asked me about my siblings. I told him their names and ages, which were correct. But then I felt pressured to impress him, so I lied and told him they were both married and have families and careers in other palces. Except really, they both live with my mom and I because they both have disabilities and whatnot that prevent them from living on their own so my mom takes care of them. I feel really bad about it, and the two are supposed to meet for the first time over breakfast tomorrow. I don't want him to find out I lied to him if my mom says something, but I'm really scared he'll think less of me or want to break it off. I really like him and can see this going potentially long term.. Should I wait on them meeting so I can tell him myself? I'm seeing him tomorrow and staying at his place for the night. I don't know if this is a big deal or not, so any advice would be much appreciated.

And i was like no, i have waited for almost 90 mins im home now and about to sleep. Next day she ignored me all day, and i was like lets celebrate your birthday another day because i was just pissed at this point but still had the intention to celebrate her birthday. But nothing from her... So yesterday i said, i dont want to be the annoying friend but please talk back? which she then replies with, Funny how you call yourself a friend after what you have done... So clearly she is pissed but i think i made the right decision...Did i do it right or is she overreacting?

I struggle with depression, severe social anxiety, and being self-conscious thanks to a horrible relationship where I was cheated on. I know it's not fair to bring that into my current relationship but there's only so much I can mentally block out. (Also I am seeing a counselor for this, but it's the weekend and she doesn't answer emails blah blah.) Relationship with boyfriend is LDR. Been talking since March, long distance since June. Went to a bar with my (21F) boyfriend (25M). A guy (20's?M) he knows bartends there frequently and he knows him only from bar talks (but he went a lot more when he lived here). Anyway this girl (20's?F) is sitting at the bar with a tablet and my boyfriend says ""do you think that's [bartender's] girlfriend?"" I shrugged so he kind of whispered to him and he nodded. Then my boyfriend said ""dude, nice"". Wtf. So then he explained how [bartender] said that at thanksgiving [bartender's] grandma said ""you found a hottie"". I was livid! Why did he say this to me! He later apologized and said he shouldn't have said that but then said things like ""what do you think the point of models are? To have attractive people to look at. But they could have a dull personality or not mesh with yours"". Which to me sounded like he was defending himself. Any advice on how to think about this would be nice. Also I put a question mark because idk if 'inappropriate' is a good word for this

I've posted a few times in this sub reddit and I have always appreciated the advice you guys give me so here I am asking yet another question. I [23/M] have been seeing a [25/F] for a few months now. We are not exclusive but we get along really well, the sex is amazing and we spend as much time as possible together. We started getting close a few months ago and it was all playful. We would playfully insult each other and tease each other and that lead to lots of sexual tension. She would often text me first and say really nice things and want me to say nice things and it was great. We would text all the time. Last Sunday was pretty amazing, we spent the day together and it was just a great experience for both of us. Then Tuesday comes around and it seems like she can't stand me anymore. She is barely replying to my texts, and when she does it always really short stuff like ""ok....."" and ""my day was good thanks"". She will take ages to reply to my texts when it used to be instant. We went from about 100 texts a day to about 10 a day in a week. She did warn me about a week and a half ago that she would probably try to distance herself because that's what she does when she starts to get close to people. Im not sure if that's what she is doing or if she is just bored of me. Maybe I am just insecure or needy, but I just don't understand how you can go from ""I get wet thinking about you inside of me"" on Monday to barely speaking to me on Tuesday.

When my fiancé and I were just boyfriend and girlfriend, he told me how his mother kept asking him for money on one particular occasion. I felt really bad about it so I spoke to her and offered her some money because she said she would be homeless without the money. I did this behind my then-boyfriend's back, which I know was wrong but I really didn't feel good knowing his mum could end up homeless. This happened a couple of times. Then-boyfriend found out about it and got really mad at me and her but everything's fine now. Since then she keeps reaching out to me for more money. It's gotten to the point where I feel like she only talks to me when she wants money. I find it really hard to deal with this because when she says she needs the money for food, that really makes me very sympathetic. I do not want to go behind my fiancé's back and give her money but I'm worried if I tell him she's been asking that he will get mad at her, and she will get mad at me for telling him. I also am a bit strapped for cash at the moment given that we are saving up for rent, bills, and food because when I move to be with him I won't be able to get a job for a while so I'm just saving every penny I can. It pains me to say no, and I also do not want this to continue for the rest of our lives. Should I just tell my fiancé and risk him being mad at his mother and then have his mother being mad at me too? I really hate confrontation and I'm not sure what the right thing to do in this situation is.

So to make a long story short, my friend Jane and I have developed serious feelings for each other. But she has a boyfriend of 3 years, John. At the end of fall semester, me and her got a little physical. Check my post history for more details if you're interested She told john about us, and after a long talk he wanted her to choose between me and him. She told him that she chose him, but in reality she wasn't ready to make a choice. Fast forward 5/6 weeks and she's still undecided but as far as John knows they're working on rebuilding their trust with each other. Go ahead and call me an asshole if you want, but I don't regret any of this. Jane and I really care about each other, and she told me that it would never have gotten this far if she didn't see me and her being as good together as her and John. She's even gone as far as telling me that she's never felt as compatible with someone as she does with me. After all this, it's almost time to go back to school for the spring. From my point of view, I'm single and she's not so while I care about her I'm gonna talk to and pursue whoever I want. But I still feel absolutely terrible for John. He has no idea any of this is even happening.

Throwaway because he's a Redditor. My bf and I (I'm F, both 20) finished our sophomore year of college, and I've gone home across the country for the summer. We've been friends 2 yrs, dating 3 months. I've always moved every 2 years, so have learned people don't keep in contact when someone leaves. Never dated before because it seemed pointless with a time limit. He swore he'd prove me wrong and that we'd make it work over the summer. It's been a week and we've texted twice, both initiated by me. Usually we text a few times every (other) day, with him initiating as often as me. He even stopped responding when I text - not like him at all. I requested to add him on Skype like he said I should, and he's not accepted. His family is stressing him out, saying he might not return to his uni in the fall. I said I'd give him space and I'm here for him because I don't want to be clingy, but I'm really worried that he's gone so noncom. Usually we tell each other anything that's bothering us. Because of my history, when we said goodbye before I left, I had this feeling like it was for good (again, he said he'd prove me wrong). Is this feeling of fear I somehow can't shake justified? I realized that if something happened to him I'd have no way of knowing, as we go to different schools and have few mutual friends. Is it normal for someone to go off the radar due to stress, or due to separation? Should I prepare myself for a ""Dear Jane"" call/text/etc.? Or is this normal for a temporarily LDR? I have no clue what I'm doing.

So this relationship is pretty new (3 months), but we've kissed and we used to see each other fairly often while school was going on. However her parents are extremely strict and we have to meet behind their back. So our carefree Summer where I thought we could spend a lot of oltime together has instead become prison for her where she is only let out of the house to go to summer classes and ACT prep. We won't be able to see each other till school starts again and it's killing us. We've talked about it before and we both still have feelings for each other and want to stay together, but at the same time we can't see each other and it's tearing both of us apart emotionally. What should we do?

Been with my BF for almost 2 years now, and generally we are great. Good sex, hardly fight, chill with each other's quirks, we watch tv and play video games together, we have even talked about moving in together in the next year or so. But every once in a while I get those moments of doubt. Those ""am I supposed to be here?"" moments. He's the first boy I had sex with. Neither of us have had sex with anyone else. Our sex is almost always great, but I always wonder what's (or more specifically who's) out there. I do not want to throw away this relationship I've built just because I kind of want to sleep with other people, but can someone just tell me I'm not alone in these thoughts? How do you deal with them? I don't necessarily feel guilty about these thoughts, because I know they're common and it's not like I'm cheating, I just wonder how you guys deal with them?

I'll start of with an apology, because english isn't my native language. I have an issue with the eating habits of my current girlfriend. My ex used to be 49kg and is a model and my current girlfriend probably weighs around +-65kg. I think my girlfriend is beautiful, but she could drop a couple of pounds not much. I've told her that numerous times as well and that she should just stay off the sugar a little. She starts her day with some fake ass orange juice with at least 20gr of sugar. She finishes her day always with a cola can (around 30gr of sugar) and not mentioning how she probably eats candy and cakes etc around the day as well. I'm a quite healthy guy. I go to the gym 3/4 times a week. Almost no sugars and carbs are only on the hard work out days. I've told her quite often now that it kinda bothers me and she says she's doing her best, but then I see her at 11pm taking a KitKat + Cola + eating the insides of some f cake or whatever. It disgusts me. Today we weren't together and I spot that she went to the f McDonalds with a friend of her this evening. Like I have no f clue what to do about it. In my opinion she's fine, but she shouldn't be ""allowed"" to eat like that, because of her weight and health.

Exactly like the title says. I opened up Instagram on our shared tablet. We both have different accounts but we follow pretty much the same people so I browsed for a bit then went to search for a friend of mine who just got IG. I didn't even realize I was on his account until I opened the search and saw that he looked up only three people: his ex, and two of my exes. One of my exes is from like, Highschool time. We broke up with I was 19. The other ex is the last guy I dated before my husband whom I have had zero contact with since the break up. I didn't even know he was on IG! My husband's ex is a woman he dated for many years who ended up leaving him for another man and nine months later out pops a baby. Gross, right? Her IG is mostly pictures of her art and them some randoms of her baby and her new man. One of my exes IG is solely of his art. The other ex of mine is mostly selfies (I know, right?) and some art. I want to believe he is just looking to see their paintings, but I don't know... I have no idea if he is lurking their FBs or anything because I chose not to go through browser history (not my style). Is this something to be concerned about or is it mere human curiosity? I found nothing interesting on any of the accounts. I'm not one for lurking/caring about what people I don't like are doing, so this isn't something I can relate to. I know my lady friends pretty much all lurk their exes and other random people on FB or Instagram, but I just don't get it... I don't know how often he looks or what the deal is. Should I bring it up? Leave it be?

Ok so I am almost 27 F, in a serious long term relationship with my boyfriend of 7 years who is also almost 27. We have lived together since almost the beginning of our relationship and our connection was very strong from the start. For a little while now, especially lately I have been feeling less and less passion towards him. I don't really like to have sex anymore or even kiss him. There have been some broken trust issues (no cheating, but some lying and covering up on his end that always get revealed). He feels me kind of pulling away, which I assume causes him to feel less of a draw or connection towards me as well...at least that is how he has been acting and speaking lately. I guess what I am asking is: is it normal for the passion to fizzle out, as the way I described? Or could this be me actually falling out of love with him, and maybe I should end it...I am scared to break up with him because I am not feeling passionate, only to find 7 years later with a new person the same lack of feelings. I don't want to be chasing around lust for my entire life...I want a life partner. So if anyone out there could offer some advice I would really appreciate it. I have heard that the 7th year is always the worst for some reason, so part of me is hoping that is what we are going through. My boyfriend and I have been best friends for so long, I can't imagine my life without him, and I'm not that scared of not being able to find someone else, just that I wont have him in my life anymore.

I got out of a 4.5 year relationship back around Halloween and hit up various dating apps and websites to try and meet new girls. I met this one particular girl in December and we hit it off, texting and snap chatting all the time, and seeing each other pretty much every week. This went on for two months and when I realized the one other girl on the table wasn't right for me, I asked her out officially. We have very good connection with each other, as we are both nerdy and play similar video games together, or watching similar favorite shows or movies together. Anyways, I like her a lot, she is a very sweet and caring girl. The only thing that stops her from being absolutely perfect for me is that she is slightly overweight. Not humungous or anything, but a bit of a beer belly. I know she had posted about trying to get in shape when we first started talking but I don't know how committed she is to it. Im obviously not going to say anything to her because that's extremely cruel at this point, but part of me hopes she can be healthy and get in better shape because I like her a lot and I'd like to see it go somewhere maybe.

So my brother and I are 10 years apart and we've always had a fantastic relationship. He is now married with two young kids of his own to which I am a very proud auntie. About 11 years ago our father passed away and left me the family piano (among other things) in his will. Now, I used to play when I was a child, but have not played it in years and as I have since moved overseas and moved out again, it has been sitting in my mum's house for years, and only gets used when the kids are visiting or a musical member of the family visits. I actually tried to sell it before I moved overseas about 2.5 years ago but no such luck - however, I was kind of glad about this as I sort of wanted to keep it in the family - however at the time he wasn't interested or really financially able to buy it as they had just bought a new house, kids starting school etc. He recently approached me via text message to ask how much I would consider selling it for, as he is considering buying it for his kids to learn on. Now of course, I jumped at the idea as once my mum's house is sold, I don't really want to keep it in storage and it certainly has no place in my cosy apartment. I would love him to have it, however he is wanting me to sell it to him and from what I understand is quite happy to pay for it. I did have it valued a couple of years ago when I was hoping to sell it back then, however I am wondering whether I need to provide some sort of 'family discount'? He is doing me a favour and would essentially be taking it off my hands, but I am wondering whether it is fair to treat it the same way as if I am selling to a complete stranger,

I have no plans of doing that because she's great and I want to marry her one day. I've told her that and she's alright but every once in a while, she starts saying ""what if you leave me, I don't want that.

It only happens when she's not with me, hence over the phone which is hard for me to control as I can't physically comfort her. Alright, it's happened again while I was typing this.

Me: 30, her 26. Let me start by saying we arent, and have not been dating per se. We have been seeing each other off and on for about 3 months, and Its been a little strange due to some other circumstances from when we first met. Now, its movie dates (theater and home-on-the-couch), daydates with random activities, etc etc. I REALLY like this girl, and just recently she friend zoned me. It sucks, and I'm bummed, but I'm not here to ask about ""how to get over it"" and be all emo. My question is this, seeing as how I am not going to let myself be a 2nd option and/or fulfill the ""boyfriend"" role without moving things forward, how do I gracefully back out of this situation? I guess what I want to say is something along the lines of ""what you want from me, and what I want from you are two different things, and I'm not going to let you use me for QT because its a waste of my time"".

I [18 F] have been with my boyfriend [20 M] for over two years. We were long distance for a year and a half, but now we basically live together. We met online, and immediately clicked. He's always loved me more than I love him, but i still loved him quite a lot. We've never had much in common hobby wise, but we used to share passions and morals. Now I avoid any talk about any social issue or topic at all costs because it just leads to arguing and bad attitudes. He's very touchy-feely, and I've never been a fan of PDA. I used to deal with it and we would laugh about our differences, but now it annoys me when he won't stop kissing me. I know it sounds like i dislike a lot about him, but that's not true. He is my best friend, and i don't ever want to hurt him. It's hard to do the selfish thing and leave, when i know we'd both be losing our best friend. I was his first girlfriend, and he loves me unconditionally. I could push these thoughts away for the last few weeks, but i don't know much longer i can do it. I had a long conversation with a flirty, good lucking guy that i just can't get out of my head. I don't think its actually the hot stranger per say, but just the interaction and the tingly feeling i got inside when chatting with him. Maybe i'm just bored... maybe i'm falling out of love.

There's not much backstory. It's my birthday and he got me a gift. I love it, but it's way too expensive. I'm not a big gift crazy person, but I appreciate these gestures. He really did a great job with it, but I KNOW he can't afford it. We are very financially open with each other, and he was laid off early this year so money has been super tight. He just started working again in a very low paying job just to make ends meet. It's taken a toll on him emotionally, not being able to afford anything and feeling like he's failed. So I get this gift, which I love and appreciate the effort he put into getting for me, but I can't help but think we would both be better off just saving the money. I'm not sure about this, but I actually think buying this put him under triple digits in the bank, which is really not okay. He should definitely be saving since he actually still owes me money. I don't want to make it too much about money and not enough about his thoughtfulness towards me, but ... I just don't know. What can I do/say that won't hurt his feelings and make him feel like he can't even do this for me?

My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year. However, as much as I love him and even though he's my best friend, I think we should break up. I've tried once this week and backed out and couldn't stop crying because I'm so scared to lose him and I don't want to hurt him. I wish I could do this without hurting him but I don't know how. We've been long distance for awhile and when we are together, everything is 100% okay. When we are apart we end up fighting every week and two weeks ago he broke up with me, only to ask for me back two hours later. I feel scared in my relationship because weird things will make him upset or sad, so I have to be careful. I've posted once before, but a long time ago I cheated by sending sexts. He has never forgiven me and a few months ago got abusive and called me names, threatened to leave me, said I ruined his life and some other things. I've always given him full access to all my accounts and stuff but he's slowly weeded out some of my friends. I had to fight with him over being able to talk to a long time friend, who is a guy but gay. I've never loved anyone this much in my life before and I'm scared I'll be making the biggest mistake of my life. We have a lot in common, we both want the same kind of futures and when we aren't fighting, he's the sweetest person in the world. I'm just lost. He's my best friend and I tell him everything. I worry he will hurt myself if I leave him too. Thank you for reading this and I'm sorry if it's confusing. I'm on mobile and I'm not sure how to phrase everything.

First of all, let me elaborate on the whole plan of studying together. We're moving from where we live now with full support from both mine and her parents. That isn't the problem. The problem is that we haven't gone out in 2 weeks now, and I'd want to discuss everything a bit more with her, but I don't find a phone call suitable. Last week she's been busier with stuff I haven't asked about, and we usually chat after 1am. 3 nights ago we chatted till 6AM. Every time I approach the situation she gets mad and tells me she won't do something she doesn't feel like doing (going out) and usually ignores me for 2 days after that. Yesterday came some good news and after acting a bit cold to her she asked me if everything's alright and I told her I don't feel like talking, after which she said that she understands and will leave me alone. She has told me before that she likes to deal with her problems alone, but I can't cope with that, and it's super annoying because every time I start talking about this she gets annoyed and ignores me.

Also, my friend who told me doesn't want me telling her because she doesn't want to get in trouble and she feels like the messenger is always shot so we should just stay out of it (this friend would be really pissed at me if I told anone else, so much so that if I were to tell people it might loose my friendship with her which I don't want). I really do want to tell my best friend though- I feel like she has the right to know (if it were me, I'd want to know)- but I am honestly concerned as to what would happen if she were to find out the truth. They had broken up for like 3 days 6 months ago and she literally woudn't stop crying the whole 3 days and didn't eat or sleep. I just really don't know what to do here.

I just don't understand why this happens. It's happened to me before too. My boyfriend Ben* has been friends with Tim* since they were 5 and Jo* since they were 16. Tom and Jo never hung out alone. Ben recently invited Tim and Jo out all the time because Tim broke up with his girlfriend. They saw a movie together and went out together about 5 times with Ben Tim and Jo and other assorted male friends of Ben. Now Tim and Jo see each other all the time and don't invite Ben. This really upsets Ben. They go and see movies and go out clubbing. Ben just invited Tim somewhere and he told him that he already has plans with Jo. Ben is justifiably upset. I am just wondering why this happens. It may sound really silly but i have had this happen to me before as well. I am confused. It seems really rude. I have always been inclusive instead of exclusive and when I organise anything I always invite everyone I think may want to come even if I know they won't. I have never done this to anyone ever. But it's obviously a common thing. I'm just wondering why. And how to go about fixing this? Ben is so hurt. Is it the kind of thing you just leave it and don't say anything? Ben has already mentioned that he was kind of hurt about it to Jo but they still aren't inviting him. *shitty made up fake names

I've been dating current boyfriend for a little over two months and things have been great. He's funny, charming, and usually very thoughtful. However, recently things have changed a bit. He's been extremely busy at work -- a lot of people recently moved on to new organizations in his office so he's handling a lot more than his normal work load -- and I'm trying to be as supportive as possible because I know he's so stressed and wants to do a good job. However he's recently been cutting out on our plans without giving me a heads up, so I end up waiting to hear from him for hours at a time because I think our plans are still on. When he does get in touch with me he's really apologetic and citing that work kept him away, but it feels like being stood up every time, and it's hurtful. I feel like I'm no longer a priority for him. It also seems to be reopening old wounds. My previous (and first) long term relationship ended over a year and a half ago for similar reasons (the straw on the camel's back being that ex was supposed to pick me up from an international airport when I came to visit him during a semester abroad and showed up almost 6 hours late). I don't want to be in another relationship where I'm simply an option, but I don't know how to talk to him about it in order to convey this. Do I bring up the past baggage? Do I simply address the surface issue? Help!

The past three women I've(22M) been with for an extended period of time have all had a lot of problems guys cheating on them in the past and generally treating them poorly and it has made relationships difficult for them. Is this more pervasive than I thought especially among my generation or am I just unlucky/attracted to girls like this? The first one I was in a relationship with but had huge trust issues. She(21F) would check my text messages/facebook/reddit accounts/email with no real cause. I didnt ever really notice it but she would tell me sometimes because she felt bad she did it. Like I'd get a text from an ex or something but then id kind of brush the ex of in my response so my gf at the time would read it and feel bad about being suspicious. The second one(21F) I was hooking up with for 6 months, and while it started as just a hook up, it turned into something more but she refused to call it a relationship or a boyfriend/girlfriend thing because of how she had been treated by past relationships. She ended it because it was feeling too much like a relationship to her after a while and thats not what she wants. The most recent one(22F) I went out on a few dates with but, despite going really well and her telling me she did like me like that, she said she didn't want to get into a relationship because of how her last relationships had treated her. For the girls who told me they didn't want a relationship, it wasn't one of the cases where they were saying it because they just didn't want a relationship with me, neither have been in relationships since they told me they didn't want one.

So, I've tried a few strategies in getting to know her better. She's 16, beautiful, thoughtful, playful and kind. I'm not romantically interested in her per say, just want to get to know her better and develop a friendship. I'm a handsome guy, (in my humble opinion) and I've never done anything to upset her. So, I've known her for around 2 years now. We've had a few short discussions about whatever, and she seems to have taken an interest in me. We don't live too far away from each other, but just far enough that I don't get to see her on a regular basis. She and I both have Instagram accounts, and that is where I've last interacted with her. Her family is slightly odd, but nothing crazy. Her parents are probably in their 50's and her brother is 18. I'm acquainted with her sibling, and we talk once in a while. Her father, though, has always been odd and reluctant to talk to me let alone include me in what they do. This may just be a fatherly defense mechanism, so it should be taken with a healthy dose of my favorite seasoning. Recently, my IG account was set to open. She liked a photo, which was a good sign. That's all, though. About 2 weeks later, I grew a pair and followed her. Since then, she hasn't responded in any way. It should be noted I tried making my profile private, as an attempt to try to draw her in. So far this has been unsuccessful, and instead of paying attention to me, someone she somewhat knows, she follows douchbags. Along with that, I've developed friendships with a few of her female friends, and I didn't experience any reluctance. SO...observations? Comments? Thoughts? Chuck Testa? Let me know!

I'm completely lost here. My roommate has been one of my best friends for 4 years now, I used to live with her boyfriend and around that time they started dating, perfect couple since then. Near the one of last year I realized I probably had some dumb feelings for her, I've been battling with depression and anxiety for a while and she's been the rock that helped me get trough most of it. I might have gotten a bit attached after that. About a month ago we were talking trough some stuff and I broke. I told her I loved her, how bad I felt for that and stuff like that. We tried to work it out the best we could. She moved out today (unrelated) and we talked a lot during this past week, she told me that she loved me too but she couldn't do anything about it, she had to think about her boyfriend and how everything affected him. We ended up getting a bit to close and heated, there were some neck kisses, some rubbing, it was definitely not ok. But we liked it. She said she was ok with it, but we should stop, there were other people to think of. The same thing happened today but apparently our roommate hear something and got suspicious, he heard some of our talks and ""accidentally"" read some stuff on my Facebook inbox (he uses my PC regularly). He had a talk with her, we don't know what to do. I love her, I really do, she helped me out with so much and has been the only consistent happy part of my life for a while. I don't want to lose her and she tells me the same, she said she was going to talk to her boyfriend today and hasn't responded my texts for a while now. I don't know what to do, my anxiety is kicking in and I'm in a really bad place with some intrusive thoughts right now.

Background: Me (23F) and my fiancee (23F) have been together 9 years, engaged for almost 5 months (also poly, so I have a boyfriend (M23) of also almost 5 months). We have done the split/take a break and get back together thing twice before. So my fiancee has always wanted to live in Japan, ever since she was a little girl. I knew this going in but it always remained a far off maybe, a sort of distant amorphous thing, that when we first got together sounded fun (because I was a teenager with nothing resembling foresight). But now it has become a potential reality, she's considering doing a program that would have her over there teaching English for 1-2 years. Here is the issue: I love her, but I can't do the long distance thing, having her be in the next county over is hard enough (due to work schedules we don't see each other as much as we would like) and I can't move to another country, away from everything and everyone I know and love, to a place where the language and culture are alien. Her dad was in the military, so moving around wasn't weird to her, I've lived in the same city since birth, my whole family is here, almost all my friends, my job that I love, I can't just drop all that and move. I love her, more than I have words for, but I don't want to stand between her and a dream that she has had since before she was in Kindergarten. I know that if she doesn't go, then she'll regret it, but if she does, then I have to either uproot entirely and leave behind my life, or do the long distance thing (a semester while she was doing study abroad was hard enough) , or end the relationship. I feel like no matter what option I choose one of us or both of us lose. And if we split, that's it, we are done (I told her if we split again that was it, we can't get back together after that, I can't handle that kind of emotional pain).

So I'm not over either of my exes. The first ex was a girl I dated towards the end of highschool . I lost my v card to her cause I knew for a fact she was the one . We were together for 3 years but she made my life hell. She accused me of raping her the day we lost it. She treated me like she was better then me in everywhere. Making fun of my ideas and my passions. Lying to me about a lot of things. Getting mad at me for seeing my friends that she hated for no reason. Even through all of that I still loved her. So after the three year marked pass , a few days after thanksgiving we had a serious agreement that ended in sex and after sex she wanted time alone to think about us . Honestly, I kept texting her telling her I'm sorry and that I loved her . During this time she was with her best friend cause he wanted to give her advice . I could go on with more detail but you guys know the end. She left me completely and started to date her best friend . I was heart broken for awhile. Didn't show up for work for a week. I tried dating other girls but I couldn't do it and I would just leave the girls and never talk to them . After 6 months of being miserable and just feeling nothing for relationships , I met the girl that changed it all. I met her at work and she was the perfect girl. She treated me amazingly and she made me forget all about my ex. I was happier then I ever was with my ex. Then shit hit the fan after 3 months . I found out she was cheating on me. She was talking to other guys while with me and tried her best to keep me a secret. It's been 4 months since that happened and I've talked to girls but I wouldn't go anywhere with it cause I'm scared I'll just get hurt again. I'm also not over either of my two exes. Each of them had something I loved that I can't find in anyone else. Everything is just making me depressed and feel alone. I don't know what to do.

I don't want to freak out or dump her or anything like that, nothing like it. I quite like her and the relationship, she has a lot of good qualities that my ex's have lacked (both cheated on me, woot woot). She is excited to introduce me to her friends, and just last week I spent 4 days at her house (we both are in our college town for the summer) meeting her parents, and I'm the first guy she has ever brought home to her parents. All in all, I don't think she's taking our relationship lightly or thinking of dumping me anytime soon. She had Tinder when we started dating, but deleted it. However last night, when I was picking a song to play on her phone (plugged into the speakers), I saw Tinder was back. No notifications, but still, she brought it back. On one hand, Tinder is pretty much a dating/hook-up app where you say ""her, we both find each other attractive, let's chat"". On the other hand , if the conversations are platonic and just along the lines of ""haha look i found my friend on here"", then there's no reason to be upset. For what it's worth, I've seen both her text and facebook conversations multiple times, and she is talking to literally zero guys on either. Just her female friends and me. The point of this topic is I want to bring it up in a calm way, and see why she has the app. I want to think of some good questions/statements for her, and need help from you guys! Thanks!

I started high school about 5 days ago. I made a bunch of new friends. I'm enjoying high school so far. Things at home aren't so good. My parents are running out of money, they won't admit it. I applied to over 200 jobs this summer, I got a couple of interviews but, once they asked for my age, things went downhill from there. Having no money limits me from my social life, I can't hang out with friends because they go to the movies and eat which I can't afford. I laugh, socialize and I appear to be happy. At the end of the day, I'm not happy, I feel lonely... I'm empty. I met this girl yesterday who's in the same grade as me. She's sweet, funny, smart and gorgeous. We exchanged numbers, and we've been texting/flirting back and forth ever since. I would love to ask her out but... I asked my parents about the whole dating shebang and they really don't want me to get involved. They say it's going to bring my grades down and I might get her pregnant... Also, I have little to no money so I don't have anything to offer her. That's about it. I don't know what to do. I can either go behind my parents back or just ignore my feelings and go back to studying... Advice?

So at a party (which was at my neighbours house) we met and we hit it off pretty well. Evening turned in to night and we were both a bit tipsy. One thing let to another and we wake up in my bed. When she leaves I forgot to ask for her number and I don't think about her for a couple of months. But then while mindlessly meatjudging on Tinder one night I see her pop up and after swiping to the right we instantly match. I didn't send her a message immediately and I kinda forgot about it until today when I wanted to send her a message. But now she unmatched me and I kinda feel that she thinks I didn't recognize her. So I want to send her a short facebook (we have mutual friends and I know her name) message saying something along the lines of: ""hey I know I didn't send you a message instantly, but I did recognize you and I'm sorry if I made you think otherwise."" I want to send her a message explaining it (and maybe to try to fuck her again because it was good) but I don't wanna seem like a creep. Do you think it'd be okay to send her a message?

I would text him from time to time just to see how he was doing (and admitedly to see if there was any spark) and the only time he ever responded was when he said ""I loved you too much to ever forgive you."" Which of course sent me into another bed ridden bout of guilt and depression. When I pulled myself together I met ""Bill"" who is considerably older than me but a really nice man and has a successful but unglamorous business. He also has two small kids whom I like but they resent me quite a bit even though I met Bill long after the divorce. I just got word thought the grapevine that Daren had graduated veterinary school, which brought up a whole host of emotions about how one bad night and I find myself with the nice but overweight divorcee with a cement pouring business and a ready made family.

I'm in the west and she's on the east coast. We have had small stints of being apart but I hate it.

I was in a long-term relationship of about 5 years before I broke up with my ex about a year ago. During this time, we've accumulated hundreds if not thousands of photos together. Most are just random everyday moments we've shared, but a few are rather intimate. Enter new gf. We've been together for around 4 months. I've taken her home previously and have given her free reign of the house and my PC. On one of these visits, she browses through my computer, which is what she normally does anyway. I step out for snacks, and when I return, she had packed up and left. Fast forward to today, I find out that the reason she left so abruptly was because she had discovered my ex's nude photos on my computer and feels like we're still in touch and that she could never ""live up to her memory"". The ex and I are no longer on speaking terms, but we were in a FWB arrangement until shortly before I met this new girl. I would like to point out btw that I did not intend to keep these photos on my computer. I'm just a very disorganized person overall, I have photos and documents laying all over the place and I sometimes forget what's what and where! I had never gotten around to cataloguing and organizing my photos after the breakup...until today, that is. I have now deleted the offending photos and archived (encrypted and moved off to an external hard drive) the non-nude, non-offensive ones, but my girlfriend still won't speak to me. I don't know what to do to apologize. I've shown up with flowers at her apartment; but no dice. She's having none of it.

Boyfriend and I have been together 7 months, when we first started dating he suffered from a mild form of anxiety which has worsened over the last 5 months in particular. He has been suffering as a result from sleep deprivation and depression as a result. When we first started dating we were both really happy and he very quickly told me he loved me (within 2 months, thankfully I felt the same). Since then we both became unemployed, while he quickly found employment it took me almost 5 months. This of course put a lot of strain on our relationship, to make matters worse he hates his job, it's a mindnumbing job but made stressful by those he works with. We started arguing a lot - not just bickering but full scale screaming ""why are we together"" type arguments (though when that's mentioned we both quickly back down). He's recently been less and less happy, with everything. He's talking about moving, he's not talking to his family and he struggles to get out of bed. He still has great days where he would walk 18 miles to see me on my first day at work and then walk me home - bringing me flowers out of the blue etc. As someone who's never dealt with anxiety/depression ive admittedly not been the most supportive SO as frankly, I wasn't entirely sure what to do (though since the early stages I have done my own research). The other day we had a huge argument, which ended in us talking it through and I apologised for not being as helpful as I could and have vowed to try harder. However, he mentioned that he may not love me- he doesn't know if he ever did or if it's just the way he's feeling at the moment. I don't want to get my heart broken and I don't know if at this point it's better to walk away?

So me and my girlfriend share a mutual friend who she is pretty close with. It is a guy and I am not really worried about her cheating on me or anything like that. The problem is that she will go to him sometimes first with any emotional issues she is having rather than me because sometimes I freak out and blame myself. I know I shouldn't do that and I have been working at it and it has gotten better. Though sometimes entirely I am left out of the loop and she only tells me after talking to him first. It does make me feel kinda uncomfortable that she can openly talk to him about our relationship and her problems without coming to me first because they have kissed once and did something else before we started dating and she won't tell me what. At the sametime I am happy that she has someone to talk to that can also help. I'd just really rather not find out late or not find out entirely. I don't want to be the kind of guy that sets limits and says ""You can't do this or that"", but I have no idea how else I can approach the subject without her getting defensive and me being accusatory.

I'm quite sure I have but I have a few little doubts; I'll try to be brief. The girl is in the same class as me, the course required a group project. I paired up with this guy I'm good friends with and then went out of my way to make sure this girl had a group because I noticed she wasn't in one with anyone else. We met without the other guy in the group to work on the project but ended up procrastinating alot since we got on quite well. I asked her for her number after and sort of made it like ""You're in the same group so it'd be good to have it, but I'd like it anyway"" to which she agreed. I asked her out for coffee and said ""I don't have studying in mind"" and she agreed to go out. I feel pretty sure that she knows it's a ""date"" but I never explicitly said and I haven't done anything like say ""you look nice today"" or flirt in an obvious way (although I plan to do this asap) so do you think she gets the message? It would be cool to get some girls opinions but I'd be glad to hear anything.

She also accused him of really bad things based on a small conversation. He told me his version and it seemed pretty accurate, so I didn't listen to her. I asked to talk to her because I was too embarrassed she looked over to my brother to say all this stuff. So she told me he ""changed her style"" and her friends got away as they dated. But he told me they had an abusive relationship for 4 years, where she wouldn't let him play games with his friends and talk to girls, and she would pick his phone to check up all his messages. When they ended the relationship she was so upset she put up pictures, his name and his cellphone number on a gay dating app. Now my brother is suspecting of him, while I trust my SO. He's been very loving and respectful to me. I'm also afraid that this girl comes back again and does something stupid to him or myself.

Well, I think the title says it all. I'm miserable and so is my husband. We're fighting constantly (about EVERYTHING), never do anything together and I have a low libido which he takes personally. We've been married for two and a half years, together for four total. We haven't been to marriage counseling yet but that's the next step. I love him but am so sick and tired of being sad, depressed and moody. I daydream about being alone constantly and wish I could just move out and leave everything behind. I think we moved into things too quickly and didn't get to know each other first. We're (well mostly him) constantly saying things like ""If I knew xxx I wouldn't have married you"" or ""If you did xxx when we were dating I wouldn't have stayed with you"". I want to be happy and I want him to be too, and if that means we separate, I'm okay with that. We rent, don't have kids and not much in savings so the split would be pretty easy (well, not easy but you know what I mean).

I admit that going through his text messages was wrong and I do feel incredibly guilty about it now but the bigger issue for me is that I found something that I can't stop thinking about. He was talking to his good female friend and I saw a text that said ""am I being an idiot for leaving [my name]""? . I stopped reading after that because I started having a panic attack. The idea of breaking up was not even on my radar and I thought he was more than happy. Again, I know I shouldn't have looked but whats done is done and now I can't stop worrying about when it's going to happen. And now i'm being clingy just because of my worry which i'm sure doesn't help. I love him and don't want to lose him.

I'm worried this is going to make me sound awful but I'm really struggling to cope. My girlfriend and I moved in together a few weeks ago and this coincided with her Grandpa getting very sick. As a result she's been visiting him at his care home or her grandma virtually every night after work. This effectively means I'm doing all the chores and cooking dinner because by the time she gets home it's too late for her to do it. Then when she does get back she's upset and needs cheering up. I'm trying to be supportive but it's wearing me out. This morning she told me not to clean the kitchen before she gets back and that she'd cook dinner but then her mum rang her and asked her to go and see her grandma after work because she's upset. I'm not going to leave the messy kitchen and the dinner for her but I'm exhausted and I'm pissed off that the rest of her family are taking so little responsibility. She's got a sister who works in our town who could visit her grandparents after work but doesn't and two cousins who also do nothing. On top of this I have an elderly Grandpa of my own who I'm struggling to visit because of the added burdens being placed on me. I'm quite stressed at work at the moment and I can't deal with the thought of going home, cleaning the kitchen, cooking the dinner and putting laundry on then cheering my girlfriend up when she inevitably comes back in tears. I want her to stop carrying her family on her back because the longer this goes on the more the others are going to just assume it's fine and they don't need to help out. Any advice?

Our roomie, lets call him Phil, is a quiet, socially awkward, fellow. He's polite, showers daily, and hardly uses the common areas of the house. He commutes to work during the week, comes home, makes a big salad, or orders takeout, then plays League until his bed time. We all hang out together from time to time, roasting smores in our fire place, sharing a meal together, or playing board games. He smells fine. The trouble is his room. It stinks! I don't think he's cleaned it since we signed the lease- nine months ago. One day Phil left his door open after leaving for work, and when I got up (three hours later) the smell was still wafting out, down the hall. I took a quick peak in to survey the state of things, thinking maybe I could just open his windows for a few hours and air the place out. There were some take out bags waiting to be dealt with, a few cups and plates, and *a lot* of clutter. Obviously, the takeout is a big problem, but it wasn't the piles of garbage I was expecting from such a smell. There was a huge pile of laundry, and a smattering of receipts, napkins, empty amazon fresh bags waiting to be returned, and a thick layer of dust and grime covering the floor and every surface. But- he's not a hoarder, he just doesn't seem to keep his room clean. I don't think he's ever swept, mopped or wiped down anything. We're worried about Phil's room, not just because of the smell, which has become unbearable(!), but because we might not get out deposit back if it continues like this. His room not only needs a serious deep clean- but it has to be maintained. We know this is going to be awkward, and we want some suggestions on how best to confront him. How can we approach him?

So about 2 years ago I got out of a horrible alcohol driven abusive relationship. I am still recovering, I've really only had countless one night stands to try to fill the void of feeling awful, like literally 4-5 times a week. I never sleep over, develop feelings or anything like that. I've finally met someone I am interested in starting a relationship with but I still have all these barriers up, I still hook up. I limit myself to seeing this person 1 or 2 times a week, I still don't sleep over. I'd like to change that but I don't know how and I am really scared to. My ex who I don't speak to was in a new relationship with in a month of our break up and says it was easier to get in a new relationship because he doesn't remember the last month of out relationship. I havent spoken to him in over a year. I am so so angry at him, I remember cleaning up his piss, vomit, shit. I remember dragging him up stairs when he passed out in his car, I remember him disappearing for days on end or strange men showing up to the apartment. This is what is preventing me from any new relationships. Any ideas on how to change?

Today, my girlfriend who I live with walked in on me taking care of myself while I thought no one was home. She is helping me through school and at the time I thought she was upset because I wasn't studying. She had just argued with her parents that I couldn't help her dad move stuff from their old house because I was busy studying. She walked in at the absolute worst time because the hours leading up to that moment I had been studying. Shes texting me now and I'm finding out that what really upset her was that she feels as though she has to force me to have sex and even thought I might have ED. She is very angry and I felt embarrassed trying to explain that it was not because I was turned on I just needed to relax a moment and keep studying. She thinks I don't find her attractive which is not true. I don't know if this is only true of me or men in general but most of the time it is not a sexual thing. It just helps relieve stress. I recently broke my leg and gained a lot of weight during that time. Sex isn't as appealing for me because of how I feel, not because of her. I tried to explain it to her but she is still very upset. How do other women feel who may have been in a similar situation? What should I do?

We've been dating since I was 18 and he was 20 and have an amazing connection. I love him more than anything, but lately things are...different. On the topic of serious discussions - When we disagree it's usually just before bed, and 9 times out of 10 he will fall asleep and leave me talking to myself. There have been many many nights where I just lay there frustrated until 2 in the morning listening to him snoring. I feel like he brings these issues up at night and then avoids the problem by falling asleep so that it can be forgotten about by morning, and let me tell you, it's the most frustrating feeling in the world. Honestly, it makes me feel like he doesn't care about how I feel. On the topic of friends/family - He has a really great group of close friends and an incredibly supportive family. I have neither. As a result we're always hanging out with his friends and going to visit his family.. but never mine. I know they're not as great as his, but they are still important people in my life that I would like to continue a relationship with. On the topic of sex - He doesn't come on to me really, ever. Once in a blue moon he will, but I initiate for the most part and I get shut down more often than I think is fair. I understand if his sex drive isn't as high as mine, but it does make me feel insecure. So to wrap it all up, I do love my boyfriend. We share a very meaningful connection that I don't want to give up. But I'm not very happy, and I feel like I should be using my early twenties to discover my own identity, and find my independence. When I imagine how I want my life to be, it's not very similar to how it is. What would you do? Have you been in a similar situation? If so, how did it work out?

My boyfriend (M27) and I (F24) have been together long-distance for a little over a year. He's much more of a ""head"" person while I'm more of a ""heart"" person. Lately I've felt a little neglected emotionally. I know he loves me because he says so, but I don't think he knows how to show or act upon it. I leave him little notes here and there and do small things for him all the time, but I'm just not sure that he's the romantic type. I've been extremely stressed out with graduate school lately, and I've felt like we're growing apart emotionally because he's not capable of really showing a lot of emotion or support. We're long distance (1.5 hrs) and only see each other on the weekends. The nightly phone call lasts maybe only a couple minutes. No other communicating or texting during the day and some nights he falls asleep early and we don't talk at all. I'm in a doctoral program and constantly stressed out. I just started therapy for OCD and anxiety, but he's been dismissive of these things and never asks how it's going. Our sex life has been lacking lately too since I've started a new birth control pill and I've been spotting / on my period on and off for a couple months (he isn't down with shark week sex). I was fine in the beginning but I'm starting to feel a lack of intimacy and passion now that I feel like he's just grossed out by me. I really think this is just the way he is. He tells me he loves me a lot and cuddles / touches me when we're together. There's really not a thought in my mind that he's cheating. I think he's just a mathematical, engineer type and hasn't dated much in the past, and this is just the way he is. How do I bring this up in conversation with him? I need to communicate that my needs aren't being met, but I don't want to hurt his feelings or insult the way he is. I love him, but I feel like I need more affection, romance, and support.

Throwaway because i'm pretty sure he's a redditor. We've only been dating for a year and a half, but i'm pretty sure i'm in love with him. I honestly cannot see myself with anyone else, and i've been in previous relationships that have lasted 3 years + that have never developed, emotionally, as far as this one. Our relationship moved pretty fast from the word go and we started living together within 6 months which may be why the emotional side of things moved at such a rapid pace, but something just tells me he isn't where i am in the relationship. 2 weeks ago, i tried to explain this to him and he was supportive and understanding, but gave no inclination that he shared what i was feeling. I want to tell him that i'm in love with him and can see myself marrying this man, but of course if he isn't at that stage which is very likely as 1.5 years isn't a long time, then i could potentially ruin what we have.

I've seen other stories and read some opinions but I really just wanted to get this out there somehow because I'm not good at talking to actual people about things So I'm in a situation that I don't know what to do about, currently my plan of sailing along and ignoring it is doing fine(ish) for fora while, but every so often like today I just can't stop thinking about it I(23M) have some pretty strong feelings for my best friend(22F) It's regularly commented that we have amazing chemistry together and that what we have is a kind of best friendship different from what other people have. Were totally inseparable, do everything together and can barely go a day without talking to each other another friend of mine only last night said that she wanted to bash out heads together and make us talk about our feelings. Her and I have actually admitted to having some feelings for each other, we once came close to sleeping together, and earlier this year we kissed a few times on various occasions. However she has said to me a few months ago that she was confused about the feelings she had for me and because we are so damn close she's affraid of risking what we have in pursuit of something more, And if I'm honest the thought of it scares the hell out of me as well, as much as I want something more to happen I think we are both too scared to do anything about it. I could be totally wrong and she might not actually feel the same way about me, despite what our mutual friends have said I mean like, she has gone on other dates whilst this has been going on between us, and so have I, but for me it always boils down to fact that none of the girls I've talked to are anything like her. This has pretty much been going on since January and it's all just so confusing and I guess any input is welcome from you guys, I just wanted to vent Thanks for reading my stereotypical story of a boy pining after his best friend

My boyfriend is leaving for army basic in about a month, and I'm leaving around the same time to study abroad. We've been together for about a year and a half, been friends longer, and have been through a lot together. A lot of people (especially my parents) have been telling me that we should break up when we leave. Both of us have never been in a serious relationship before, and we're young, so people say we need more time to grow and expand our horizons. Not to mention that military life is tough. I really love this guy, and he loves me and I think we can make it. I actually think I'm more suited to military life than some girls because I like traveling and am very adaptable. I'm don't cling to my surroundings or need a ton of friends. But I don't want our relationship to hold each other back from any positive growth or career and education opportunities. I'm getting my undergraduate degree right now, and I want to go to graduate school. Should we stick it out, and work seriously towards making a life together and getting married young (more common in the military)? Should we just date casually and not think about the future yet? Or take a break or break up permanently to expand our horizons? I'm really torn, I don't want to throw away what we have and lose my best friend, but I don't know if military life is what I want, or if a girlfriend or wife is what he needs.

I have been dating my girlfriend for approximately 3 years, since our junior year in high school. We're now in our sophomore year of college, and are at the end of our ropes. We both love each other and don't want to spend our futures with anyone else, but she goes to school states away while I work and go to school at home. The past few months something has been off, and we have been trying to work on it. The problem really can't be anything other than the distance, as everything is fine when we're together, but when she goes back away she gets this really odd attitude. She's very transparent and I know for a fact she's not cheating on me and the problem isn't the other guys and seeing room to grow, she has told me this repeatedly. It's strictly the distance when we're apart. The other day she called me and said she was somewhere in between wanting to go on a break till she's home in May and ending it completely because the distance was just too much. She was in tears mostly because neither of us can realistically see a future with anyone else and both our families love the two of us, respectively. I woke up today feeling more empty and lost than I knew was possible, and I don't know where to go without her. I need to know how to fix the problem because I have given this relationship my absolute all and to think that there's anything else I could do is ridiculous. I don't have a clue what to do but I know we both want this to work out, it's like we both know we found the perfect person, just at a shitty time.

Hi Reddit, Bit of a silly situation here so I will try to explain briefly. The guy I'm seeing, Dan, has a longtime (20-years) friend from school -- ""Mike"". They get along and work at the same company, but lately his friend has been acting kind of strange to him -- including sending him some out-of-the-blue, bitter-sounding text message rants and just generally seeming resentful and put out about everything. My BF showed me these messages but only briefly, to ask my advice on how to handle the situation. I was a bit perplexed. There's nothing specific that prompts them, they just have the tone of someone who is...well...butthurt. It's only happened twice in last few months and then things get 'back to normal' between them. However, I got a call from another friend of theirs at work who asked me if I had been giving Mike friend any romantic interest, because he had been 'making inquiries' about me, such as asking about my age and if there was anything between us!! I was shocked. I briefly worked at the same company but in a different department than both of them, so he does know who I am. But we have only interacted socially at my BF's birthday party with my BF around, we have never hung out alone, never added on FB, never texted, etc etc. I would say we do not know each other well. I hesitate to tell my BF the situation, because it sounds like so much gossip, and if it's not true, it will bust up their 20-year friendship. The person who relayed this information to me is a bit of a gossip lover himself. Should I say ""hey babe, this info may have to do with why his nose is out of joint?"" Or should I just say nothing in case it's a misconstrued rumour? I am positive I have never done anything to lead this guy on. I feel like I'm playing broken telephone....sigh. Very silly.

My girlfriend has been asked by a mutual friend of ours (25M) to accompany him to his staff christmas party later this month. Normally I would be alright with it but this is a bit different in my mind. We have both been friends with this person for a long while, longer than our relationship. My SO and myself were friends for years before we decided to have a relationship as well. The thing is with this guy is that he's a scumbag, I have cut ties with him an no longer friends for the most part but she continues to talk and hang out with him regularly. He has just done a lot of questionable things in the past, such as going to Europe and while on vacation he told every woman that he came across that his fiance was murdered back home and gave them a big sob story to get himself laid. Little did they know that she was alive and well, just getting cheated on. Their relationship has been over for a year now. It makes me quite uncomfortable that she is going to a huge party with him as he does not seem like someone to be trusted anymore. To add icing on the cake, they used to fuck back in the day and he has professed his love to her as well as to me about her back then, but not in recent years. He has also been talking to her over the last two weeks about how lonely he is and how miserable he is.. Maybe if he wasn't such a piece of shit and treated women better they wouldn't continue to leave him. She has not come home from work yet so we haven't had time to talk it over but I was just reaching out for some advice... Personally I have quite a problem with it and wish that she wouldn't go but she really wants too and it sounds like she will be. Now she's talking about going out to buy a new dress and looking into getting contacts so she can get all dolled up and go out without her glasses... she didn't want any of these things when I asked her to my Christmas party last week. Maybe I'm just looking in to it too much...

My bf, of a year and a half, had to move over 3 hours from his family, and 2.5 hours from me this summer for an internship. He took the internship only because it looks good for graduate school to have some related experience. So far he has been pretty miserable there, except for when I came to visit. He doesn't get a lot of work to do so he just wastes a lot of time during the day( his work comp doesnt even have a headphone jack so he cant watch movies/tv or listen to music to pass the time), he doesnt work with anyone his own age, and really only works with a handful of people in general. The little work he does do is boring and tedious, and is not at all what he wants to do. The people in his apartment building seem to keep to themselves and dont really seem like the type of people that he would be friends with anyway. So his work sucks and has no friends around after work. Also he doesnt have a car so he can't even drive anywhere to get away from the small boring town he lives in. I try to be positive and be available to talk often, last week I even sent to him romanticish email about my feelings for hims, just for something different. But he still seems kinda depressed. It also doesnt help that he was sick yesterday and his internet often goes out. I know its only for a few months but I feel like hes pretty lonely and bored 95% of his days there.

My partner and I (who cohabitate) have been having a rougher than usual patch in our relationship due to a lot of work stresses, grad school applications, and financial issues. Months ago we promised a friend from college who's been going through their own personal issues they could stay with us while working on a short-term (month-long) project in our city. No details were ironed out until a few days ago when they contacted us asking for a ride from the airport tomorrow. Our stresses are about to reach a fever pitch and this friend is coming in tomorrow. Problem is, I've been sleeping in our guest room for two days now. I'm terrified that our relationship that is already dangling by a thread will be totally destroyed with this extra person around who does not have a car nor is able to help contribute financially. Partner is threatening to get an apartment just so that he can focus adequately on what he needs to do, AKA resting (we're both in the middle of super crazy, i.e. 80-90 hour work weeks until february) and applying to grad school. He's currently in the other room waiting for me to come up with a solution. I don't know what to do here... Our friend is in the middle of really hectic times with their own life. Our college is less than an hour away and a former professor of ours is working on the project with our friend. I don't know if I should call and beg him to help or what... OR even offer to pay for a room for our friend to stay in our college town, which I can't really afford since we're having our own financial issues. But I don't want our friend to feel abandoned....

... and now she has a new boyfriend. They've been dating for around two weeks. She told me she's going to love him more than she she loved me, and that they've been talking about moving in together, family, marriage. I know this sounds crazy because she is crazy, and her craziness is part of why I love her. I've found after a few weeks of being single that I'm still in love with her and would like to get back together with her. I want to believe that she's doing all this to make me upset and jealous, but if that was the case wouldn't she just take me back? As to why I broke up with her, I had just turned 21 and wanted more time to go out with my friends to bars and such and not be tied down by her. After doing the bachelor nights out thing I've realized it's not that great. She had texted me several times and I thought I had done her favor by ignoring her, helping her get over me. As recently as two days before the new relationship started she was texting and telling me that thinking about us kept her up at night. Now it seems I've shot myself in the foot by ignoring her. We had a fairly stable relationship, and I can't help but feel I left out of my own selfishness.

I'm in a very odd long-distance relationship. We've known each other for 3 years now and finally got to meet recently. Things didn't get semi serious until a few months ago, due to us living in other states and other things that made things difficult. The most current being I'm stuck in a lease with my ex until April. In either case, while we aren't technically together right now, I feel very strongly for him and he knows this. I'm working on getting to the point that I feel okay moving to another state and leaving all I know behind, simply because I want to be with him. However this can't happen until my lease is up even if I feel mentally able to handle the move next month. Recently he asked me if I would be okay with him getting a friend with benefits until I could relocate. I didn't know what to say, but it made me feel sick. I told him I don't know how I feel about it, and that I don't want to know about it if it happens but now it's all I can think about. My depression I've felt since coming back home from visiting him has increased greatly and I can't stop worrying about him sleeping with someone else. He said it wouldn't be anything more than sex and that he's set on being with me once I can relocate, but I'm so afraid that his just for sex fling until I can be there will turn into more. And I'm worried that even if he doesn't end up sleeping with anyone, I'll subconsciously hold it against him because I told him not to tell me if he did so I'll assume he did when he didn't. Am I being selfish for not wanting him to sleep with anyone else even though he can't sleep with me and we aren't technically together?

Okay, so this is a really weird situation. My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year, and things have been really great so far. She tells me the other day that she was talking to her ex. I'm fine with this, they broke up a couple of years ago, they're not super close but have stayed in touch. He's moving across the country in a couple months and has been cleaning out his house/packing up his stuff. He came across a gift he bought her when they were dating but I guess forgot to give her. It's a sex toy. Some fancy vibrator or something. So he tells her about this, basically ""hey, this is pretty random but I found a gift I bought for you when we were dating, I totally forgot about it. It's a really nice vibrator. do you want me to mail it to you before I move?"" My GF showed me the conversation that night and it doesn't seem flirty or anything. I think he honestly just found this gift he forgot about and didn't want to throw it out because it's expensive. She responded with something like ""yeah that is really random, I don't know how I feel about that, I'm going to think about it and get back to you"". And she asked what I thought. I told her that it seemed super weird, I mean, really? Getting a sex toy from your ex? She said yeah, she agreed, but it's not like there's any feelings between any of them or any romantic intent, and apparently this thing is really expensive and nice. She doesn't really have any sex toys herself. I can tell that she wants to accept it, but I feel weird about it.

So the story goes like this: I've known this girl since 7th grade. At first we were in the same class, later we only had some courses together. We weren't super close, but we talked occasionally and sometimes hung out together, mostly with other people around. She usually is pretty shy and in no way did I ever get the impression that she was romantically interested in me or anyone else for that matter. Last week we both graduated. Since then I haven't really seen her, but she started texting me almost every day, asking me how I am doing, what I am doing over the Summer, jokingly inviting herself over to my place, yaddi-yadda. All of this came extremely unexpectedly for me. I believe it's rather obvious she seems to have a crush on me or something, but she hasn't explicitly asked me on a date yet. I think she's nice and all, but never really thought about her that way. How do I deal with this?

Names: Jessica (Ex); Michelle (Current GF) I was with Jessica for over 3 years and i broke up with her because i started feeling like the relationship was gradually falling. I became friends with Michelle that was alot of fun and i enjoyed being with and going out with and ended up asking her out after a drunken night as payback because i was angry at Jessica. Slowly she started sleeping over and then gradually moved in by herself without me telling her to move in. Its gotten to the point that i really do not wanna be with her and i want to get back with Jessica. she knows this and wants to get back with me as well but i cant kick this girl out of my house. i try over and over and she ends up coming back in because im too ""soft"" i guess you can say. I miss Jessica so much and i really want HER to be with me. Its been about 6 months that i've been with Michelle and i want it to end for good but i really do not want to hurt her cause she ends up crying and i give in... what can i do? One and for all.

I'll start off by saying that I'm a long time sufferer of depression and have bi-polar disorder and occasionally suffer from auditory hallucinations. I've been on medication for a while now and have been seeing a therapist and neurologist and was actually meant to be institutionalized. I was already depressed before I met and started dating my boyfriend, which was 6 years ago. Over the last 6 months, my condition has consumed my life and it's taken a huge toll on my relationship. Due to my insecurities about myself, somehow I got it in my head that my SO was cheating on me and I would find myself accusing him and berating him and even made up an 'imaginary' him from the past which he was suddenly acting different from. During this time, he also lost his job and that made things doubly stressful. This last weekend, I actually had an epiphany and realised that I'm wrong and he's not different at all, except in the fact that if we fight one more time, he has already said that the relationship will be over. We made up, I cried and apologized profusely and things feel a little shaky since then. I don't know if I've outgrown the relationship since we've been together for so long or if this is normal (it's my first real long term relationship) but we feel more like best friends than lovers lately. We goof around all the time together and the loving, romantic side of the relationship feels like a distant memory. I'm 100% positive that I love this man and I want to be with him for the rest of my life and I'm ashamed of myself for the way I've treated him. Making a long story short, Reddit, I want your advice on how I can revive those feelings (if it's possible?) and make him and myself fall head over heels for each other again.

I'm shocked and not quite sure how to deal with this. His best friend (also a good friend of mine) texted me and told me that my ex is into cocaine now, and that he's been asking our other high school friends to do it with him. We broke up last September after a year long relationship because our colleges are very far apart. I'm over the fact that we broke up but he was my first love and I still care about him in some way. I don't want him to throw his life away. He has depression and I know the coke will only make it permanently worse the longer he uses it. Also, we hooked up several times over Thanksgiving and Christmas break. He seemed completely normal over Thanksgiving and a little ""off"" during Christmas. He promised me both breaks that he hadn't slept with anyone else, but he also said that the party scene at his school wasn't that great. Obviously if cocaine is readily available, the party scene isn't as dead as he made it sound! Should I get myself tested for STDs? Should I try to get him to stop or talk to his best friend about convincing him?

So I will be going to Law School in the next year, and for most of undergrad I was able to live at home to save money. My girlfriend and I have been together for two and a half years. Lately she has been really pushing for us to move in together when I go to law school. I am not opposed to the whole thing, but there are certain circumstances that pertain to my situation. She works full time and goes to school full time. In law school I will barely be able to work, and the bar association has strict rules for law students as far as how much they can work, so she will be the one providing the majority of the finances. My parents also told me that they would help me out. She told me that she would support me to accomplish my dream of going to law school. As with any school financial situation, student loans do not have to be paid on while in school, so that is not an immediate financial issue. Basically, I find it flattering that someone is willing to support me to accomplish my dream, but I do not want to place that burden on someone else. I do realize my parents have been helping me out, and my girlfriend and I have been together for almost three years, but the whole situation would be an immense amount of trust.

I've (F30) been in a relationship with a great person (M31) for a while now (close to a year). 3 weeks after we got drinks for the first time, I was at a bar and made out with an acquaintance. We were not exclusive at this point and had seen each other 4 or 5 times prior to this. Before this I was in a really bad relationship for a few years and had spent the last 3 being single and casually dating, so this wasn't brand new ""behavior"" on my part. I normally had 1 or 2 people in my rotation. For context's sake I was always open and honest with people about my expectations and a lot of fun times were had by everyone involved and there were never any hard feelings when things were over. On the upside this make out made me realize I didn't want to do the casual thing anymore, that I wanted to see if something serious could happen with this person and it did and now I'm very happy. But recently I've been thinking about that incident. I know I didn't cheat, I didn't even know if I wanted to seriously date yet (but after the make out I knew that I wanted to explore that) and we didn't have the exclusivity talk till 3 months later. I also have never asked if my SO had been seeing anyone else in those first few weeks and to be honest I really don't care to know. I also never told them this happened because we were still getting to know each other casually and it hasn't really crossed my mind again until now. So all this being said, why do I feel rotten about it? I know that logically I didn't do anything wrong but I still feel scummy.

I'm really nervous and I leave in 30 minutes, so please help me out guys and gals. I caught her checking me out last week (I was checking her out too) at my new job and yesterday I decided to try to talk to her. Things went great, I sat down and the conversation was very smooth and dare I say it... natural? I got her number and we texted a lot yesterday, and today I saw her again and we chatted some more. My friends at work say it seems like she's into me, and thought I should ask her out, so I was going to ask her out after talking on the phone with her tonight, (which she responded with, ""Yes, I would like that. =)"" but then she hit me up a little bit later asking me if I had plans *tonight*, and when I said no she invited me to the movies with her and her friend (and her friend is bringing someone, apparently). Also when I said ""Hey gorgeous"" through a text today she responded with ""Hi handsome :3"" So I'm not sure if this is a date or not. And if it is (or isn't) I'm not sure if I should make a move. She's one of those drop dead gorgeous girls that don't really realize how gorgeous she really is, so I'm super nervous, especially since I haven't been on a date in a while.

My boyfriend of a year doesn't like birthdays, especially birthday parties. He loves parties but doesn't like them when he is the center of attention. He doesn't like photos where he's the center of attention. When we first started dating, he refused to even tell me when his birthday was until I finally prodded it out of him. I come from a background where birthdays were the one time in my life where I got what I wanted. I had a party, got to eat the food I liked, and even got presents that I actually wanted. It was such a rarity that I always get excited on my birthday. My boyfriend loves contributing to my birthday, and has contributed to cooking me the food and cake that I like and attending my parties with me. He even showers me with gifts. His birthday is a bit away. Last year I made him this ice cream cake that he wanted and got him a small present that he opened in private. I also had his friends over while they were unaware it was his birthday to have a small dinner get-together, and he seemed content with that. Eventually, however, they discovered it was his birthday when his mom posted on facebook so it became a birthday party and he got really uncomfortable. I don't want to steamroll him into having a birthday, but I'm also worried that by not acknowledging it at all I'm not showing my appreciation for him. He's the best boyfriend I have ever had, so I don't want to fuck it up. What should I do?

Neither of us has cheated on the other person. Whenever he is away from town for a few days I get sad and restless. I don't believe its the sometimes nice feeling of missing someone and its not a trust issue either since I don't believe he will cheat on me.

My gf and I have been dating for 9 intense months. We've been pretty much living together since day 1, making it official at like 5 months or so. I am definitely in love with her, and we have a great relationship outside the bedroom. In the bedroom, however, we are running into issues. I was very inexperienced before we started dating, and she was the polar opposite. She was very sexually open, worked at a fetish shop, experimented with polyamory, ect. Since I'm so new to the game, I'm pretty vanilla in the bedroom, and it is starting to get to her. She wants me to be more rough, and include choking/spanking/ect to the routine. I'm kind of at the place where I'm just looking to explore some new positions and just don't particularly get turned on by the rough stuff. Having said that, making her happy is super important to me, so I'm willing to give it a shot. I've been being generally rougher with her, pulling her hair a bit, spanking while in doggy style, definitely basic stuff. Whenever I try to do the more hardcore stuff, i.e. choking, it just feels super awkward and I'm very worried I'm going to hurt her. It sometimes has the unfortunate side effect of making me go soft because of the concern. Does anyone have any advice on how to get this going, and hopefully make me feel less awkward about it? I honestly just have no idea what I'm doing, and unfortunately she's not much help. Whenever we talk about it, she just says things like ""you just gotta feel it!"" and ""just let loose."" That gives me nothing to work with, since this inherently isn't in my character as a person. How can I effectively do this? Position recommendations? Anything can help!

It was not a very serious relationship, only a couple months, with a second week long 'fling' a couple months after splitting. But, she is one of the most refreshing people I've come across in a while, I tend to be pretty picky and when this didnt work out I struggled with it a bit. Basically I realized I had feelings for her and she did not feel the same, I was doing pretty well with accepting the situation, disappointed and the expected ups and downs the weeks following but I was feeling surprisingly stable and ok, and had sorta even started seeing a new girl which was helping the process of moving on. Anyway, while we were together she gave me her password to various things, I honestly never made an effort to remember them or anything except one which was very easy to remember that is used for her pandora which I still use on my phone. I know it's not any excuse but it seems worth mentioning I was drunk. I was listening to pandora and it asked me to confirm the login, which I did. Then i wondered if that was the same login for her facebook. I tried it and it was. I've never been one to invade someones privacy like that, I dont know what I wanted to find or not find, new bf i suppose. I read a couple messages and foruntely she doesnt really use it for messaging and I avoided dealing myself any added mental anguish. I knew what I was doing but i guess I was just riding the impulse to see what i could know. After logging out I couldnt believe I did that, my heart was racing and couldnt sleep after. This morning I feel extremely ashamed for doing that to her, I am a 30 year old man and am too old to be playing these types of games with myself. I'm just feeling really awful about myself over it. Not to mention its taken me 12 steps backward in my moving on. Part of me wants to tell her I did that, and tell her to change the password.

We ended our 3.5 year relationship two weeks ago but we still see each other every day. Both of us have pretty much just been friends for the last year of our relationship so staying friends now hasn't been a problem. Before we have sex he always reminds me that developing any feelings is just going to be a problem since he likes another girl now. But then after the sex he cries. It's not like it's pathetic when he cries, I just don't understand why this happens. Out of the two of us he's the one who wants to stay broken up the most. He's always trying to be the responsible one and hold off from anything sexual until he just gets naturally worked up from being around me. We've talked about being friends with benefits, since that's essentially what we are already, but it might be too early. The sex has been better than ever since I never really wanted to do it when we were dating. Now that we're over the fact that he's harder to get makes him 100x more attractive to me. Half of our dating issues were about how little sex we had. He gets off twice a day on average so he's normally a very horny person. If I had to guess why he cries it's because he either feels guilty, since he doesn't think with his head when he's worked up, or because maybe the sex brings up some feelings he doesn't want to experience. He doesn't even understand why he feels this way after. Can anyone explain why this happens?

I have very little dating experience so I decided to join OKCupid a month ago. The men who were messaging me weren't really my type so I decided to initiate contact with men who I found interesting. I eventually landed on an interesting profile a few days afterwards so I left a message. He seemed interested and we got along fairly well. He complimented on my looks and he asked me out to dinner a week later and I agreed that I would. We never discussed further details even though we found out that we lived 15 minutes away from each other. We continued to message on the site until I decided to ask for his number to text him. I've never been a big texter so I completely understand if people don't want to text back sometimes. When we first started texting, we texted back in forth throughout the day. Eventually it started to dwindle and he would go a day or two without texting me back. He does have a 8-4 weekday job so I do consider that. I thought it was kind of weird how he would continue the conversation 2 days later instead of just starting a new conversation. Regardless, I never sought ""revenge"" on him by texting him back later; I replied when I could. The majority of the conversation is made by me. I'm the one who asks the questions and sends funny pictures. He reciporcates occasionally. I always wait for him to reply to send another message. He still hasn't asked to meet in person so I decided to ask him to have a last minute late night meal at a local diner but he refused and said that he was 'unkempt and that it would be a bad first impression'. He has dropped hints about meeting up but not as of recently. I'm not emotionally invested in him but I just want to know if I should even bother anymore? He seems like a nice guy but I don't want to be pushy or anything. What should I do?

I've already told her before that I find it hurtful when she doesn't appreciate what I want to do, and her ver batim answer was that she didn't have to care about what I thought since she and my dad are paying for it.

Just as we had recently gotten intimate, we got into a minor argument (she wouldn't let me kiss her because I had a minor cold, which was a new reaction to me so I was taken back but understood). She called me selfish and needy and I said that hurt a bit and it just takes a bit for me to understand at times. She gave me the silent treatment. Anyhow, she went distant on her texts to eventually deleting me off her buddy list after I emailed her asking what's the matter and if she wanted to end things. I courted her for 3 months and saw her on average of once a week (so her calling me needy was a shocker). I treated her with the utmost respect. Why would a girl do this? She's 26. I was always initiating to go out, but she'd always accept it and it's not like we talked everyday or texted a bunch.

My partner (30 m) of almost 2 years has always kept in touch with his 2 ex girlfriends. He dated each of them for several years, one for more than 6 years, so I (28 f) completely understand wanting to casually stay in touch with someone who shared so much of your life. I'm positive he'd never physically cheat, so it never bothered me. This morning I went to plug in his phone and make sure he had an alarm set (as I usually do for him in the morning). When I opened the phone, his conversation with one of them came up as it was obviously one of the last things he'd done before crawling into bed after a night out. I didn't scroll up to see more because that felt like snooping, but what was on the screen was basically along the lines of ""I miss you, and I wish we could still be together"". Earlier in the summer I saw something similar from the other ex where she said something along those lines to him, and chose to ignore it because things were so great with us that I didn't even consider it a problem. When he's talked about them before, it's always with relative fondness but he always emphasized that they weren't right for each other. I even flat out asked one day after such a talk if he felt I was just the next best thing because he couldn't have them. He reassured me that wasn't the case and has shown me he cares for me. Now I understand I could be misinterpreting. Things are a bit rough right now for him (job changes, extreme financial stress, etc) and probably the pressure is making him miss happier/simpler times in his life, which they would be part of, so I don't want to approach this from a place of anger. Is it fair to ask him to cut back on his communication with them so he can stay focused on the present? How can I approach him about being more open about what he's feeling and encourage him to use me as his support base instead of them? I'm going to try and have a really open discussion about them again, and I'll come clean about what I saw, but I think I need some advice before I delve into these murky waters.

Hi everyone. I just made a reddit account for the express purpose of seeking solace from my emotions from all you good internet people. New to this so if there's anything I can do to format better or clarify please tell me! Some context! My girlfriend and I have been friends for five years now, started dating a year ago during my senior year of highschool. What made us such close friends made a great relationship too. Had a blast for a year but long distance, (we went to different universities about four hours away from each other), made it a little difficult. Eventually she lost those feelings for me and broke up with me. That was a little more than a month ago. I had to skip the grieving because of finals and I could not afford to grieve during that. I made it by with overwhelming support from a lot of friends. We talked today for the first time since then, meeting up to talk and catch up. It was great and I felt like a friendship was possible. We said our goodbyes and I went for a run. It's past midnight at this point. (Spontaneous late night running!) Messaging her periodically, I found she was out on a drive with her ex before me, just as friends. I don't doubt her sincerity in it just being a casual chatting thing but that knowledge just tears me apart inside. I know its psychologically wired in us to feel jealousy in these kind of situations but this is breathtakingly painful. For the first time in years I can't handle my own emotions. I feel like I'm being dramatic. I know that this just needs to run its course. I know logically, this breakup made sense and she's done nothing wrong. Her being with her ex is perfectly fine as well. But why does it hurt so much? What can I do to alleviate it?

He works in the union and is a hard worker and has such a big heart. This break up kind of came out of no where. He seemed more distant the past 2 days but nothing I didn't think we could work on.

Hello Redditors, I need a little bit of advice or someone to tell me I'm being silly if I am. I'm getting married next week and I'm absolutely over the moon. However, my future brother in law, my husband's only sibling, has just told us that he will be leaving our wedding reception after the meal as him and his girlfriend need to go home and get rested for their vacation which they are leaving for at lunchtime the next day. This means that they'll be leaving our wedding at 7pm, despite the fact that our reception lasts until midnight. I'm aware that staying until the bitter end isn't everyone's cup of tea, but my husband is upset because he always imagined at his wedding one of the last guests to leave would be his brother. My BIL is going on vacation with his girlfriend of 10 months, and since he started dating her he's changed. He's always taken away from family events early, doesn't get to see us on holidays until he's spent time with her family etc. I've always let it go because it's none of my business, but I am hurt that they're now going to leave my wedding early and use their vacation the next day as a convenient excuse. Am I being silly? How do you think my husband and I should handle this situation? Or should we just leave it? Thanks for your advice.

As months gone by, things just gotten worse from there. We started to have less and less sex and by the end of the first year, our sex went from 4-5 per month into about once a month. Now almost hitting the three years mark, we barely do anything. I tried to make my moves on her, she keeps rejecting me as she sees it (or anything sexual) as ""annoying"" or ""something that gets on her way"". We tried talking about this but she said that her depression caused this lack of sexual desire. I don't know if it's true but this significantly affects my love for her. I do love my GF so much but I can't really say that I can see myself with someone who will not be able to sexually satisfy me forever. I know that sooner or later, I would need to find someone who can. What should I do?

So the mother of my child are not together because I don't have those feelings for her. We had a drunk night and had sex and she got pregnant. Now my kid of 2 months is all that matters. But her side of the family insists of me being with her and getting together. They tell me it's best for the child. But I really don't want to be with her. I don't have feelings to like her or be with her. My child, I do love. I see her twice a week. Am I doing the right thing? Or should I be forced to be with her. She one time asked if we will ever be together. I didn't answer. I don't want to hurt her feelings either.

My fiance and I have been together for a year and a half, and we're getting married September 21st. I am SO happy with him and I know without a doubt we're supposed to be together. I have some baggage, though, that I want to deal with before then for the sake of his sanity and mine. Here's the deal...my mother is a controlling psycho and my father an alcoholic/coke addict. They have a very codependent relationship. I have seen myself getting more and more controlling. Babysitting my SO when it comes to chores, where he's going, what he's doing, etc. I hate being like that, and i know it's based out of my insecurity. I don't know how to stop or if I need to just ask him to make special accommodations due to my insecurities? Is that fair? It all came to a head last night my fiance got completely obliterated drunk. (Keep in mind he doesn't do that EVER.) He was being a jerk. Well, it sparked some sort of mental thing and I had nightmares about being with an old ex of mine who was extremely abusive - physical and sexually. In my dream I was raped nightly and people watched and didn't do anything about it. It was horrifying. I know it's not my fiance's fault that this happened....but it was sparked by his drinking and out-of-the-norm jerkish behavior. So how do I work through these issues and stop trying to mother him? Do I do it on my own? Should we do it together even though it's not his problem? I feel a bit lost.

I'm on mobile, sorry for formatting. My bf and I have known each other for a year and I've met both his families because his parents are divorced. I'm more close to his half sister and brother (on his dad's side) because I've babysat them before. His mother's daughters are a different story though. The first time I met them, I acted all excited because I had to travel to the city to meet them and I bought gifts for them to make a good impression. I did have fun with them, but since they're younger than my own siblings (both in their tween years), I found that I didn't have much in common with them. They are so hyperactive and loud and I find that I don't have the patience and energy to put up with them. His siblings are also quite spoiled by their mother and act like big babies/whine all the time. My bf is really close to both his younger sisters and I feel like he shows them more affection than he does to me. Physically and emotionally. I know everyone would pick their family first, but he always says how annoying his mom's family is and how she's manipulative. Recently, his mother and sisters showed up to our place somewhat unexpected and they slept over. I don't have a problem with them sleeping over on the weekend, but what I do have a problem with is that I had to go to work in the morning and I was exhausted when they came over. I stayed quiet for a majority of the time and everyone noticed. I can't find common ground with them and my bf has told me ""if you can't get along with my family, I don't think our relationship will work."" Reddit, how do I deal with kids.

Hey everyone. I'll start with a little background of myself and my current SO. I am 20 and work as a Department supervisor at Home depot. Growing up, out of my friends, I have always been the one to have a lasting relationship. While most of them we're just ""hooking-up"" or having 2week to month long relationships I was having the months to year long relationships. In my senior year of highschool I was dating a chick about 2 years younger than me. I really thought she was going to be the one for about the first year of our relationship. It eventually hit the brick wall where I felt nothing for her anymore. Things I thought were cute or funny before turned into annoyances. The sex life was dull and pretty boring. I eventually broke it off because my feelings were causing problems and I didn't want to drag her along in a dying relationship. A couple months later I meant my current SO and we've been dating for about a year and 8 months. I am her first ""serious"" relationship and she lost her virginity to me. Everything has been great, we've had our little problems just like any normal relationship but I feel like I'm starting to hit that brick wall again. I've read about this happening at certain stages in relationships but I don't know if it's just me and I'm not sure if this is a normal feeling or if I'm being selfish in expecting too much or what? I know that she is head over heels for me and would do anything which is a nice thing to have. It just feels like the little things she does that were cute or funny are become annoyances etc etc. Our sex life is okay, it has been better but it is not bad by any means. I hope I did this right and gave the information needed, if not just ask and I won't have any problems answering. Thanks in advanced.

My gf and I have been dating a year and a half. It's hard because I'm in law school and she definitely doesn't give me the space I need. Last night I was studying and she barged in called me a c *nt, b *tch, mistake (she moved here for me), and idiot. I thought she was going to hit me. I think it's because of the stress from school but we've grown apart the last two semesters. We live together but it feels like we're strangers/roommates who don't particularly like one another. The only hesitation I have is I think to before law school (a year ago) when I LOVED being around her, couldn't get enough of her, and just genuinely enjoyed her company. Now, she makes passive aggressive remarks about how I choose school over her, is jealous of some of my close (straight) female friends, and just seems miserable with her life in general. I want us both to be happy. Is there any reason I shouldn't call it quits? Should I focus on good times from a year ago, or is it better to leave it in the past?

This morning, around 3am, I received an angry email from a very good guy friend [29M]. He told me he no longer wanted to remain friends because our friendship was disrespectful to his current relationship. He stated he didn't want to risk losing his gf [32F] since he loves her (odd, since he had only bitched about her in the past) and I should never contact him again. This hurt deeply since he was a VERY good friend. We've been friends for a few years and have done so much together like reddit meetups, random bar/geek events, chatting everyday on gchat, Comic Con, etc. I have never hit on him or expressed any romantic interest. And I've been a friend through his past two relationships so his cutting contact had me blindsided. And I thought, this is going to happen more often. I'm getting to that age where men are settling down and their spouses probably do not want single women in their husbands' lives. And I should respect that, like my friend said. I have a few other guy friends now and I feel like drifting away from them. I feel that weaning myself off from them will be for self-preservation as it's going to save me from future misery. What do you guys think? Sorry. This was more of me thinking out loud. I'm very saddened I lost a very good friend. It's going to be so different from now on.

A couple weeks before we broke up, I lent my now ex-boyfriend my bass guitar so he could record a song (it's a nice bass and he's always loved playing it). He lives two hours away from me, so after the break-up we planned on meeting before one of his weekly choir practices, which is half way between us, so he could give it back. Three months later, I don't have it. We've planned on meeting many times, but he's cancelled each one. Now, I haven't even heard from him in weeks—he hasn't answered my calls, he's blocked me on Facebook, he doesn't log into Skype, and didn't answer me when I messaged him via his music page on Facebook. Instead, he posted a status about all the cool bass lines he's been writing. As you can imagine, I'm quite frustrated. I know he had a hard time with us breaking up, but it's been months and he's still acting like a kid. I've never been in this position; what's the appropriate way to handle this? Threaten to get police involved? Call his mom? I don't want to be a crazy ex-girlfriend.

So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 1 year now, and will be at one year this may. We have made it until this weekend without any major fights, mostly because of our honesty and openness. I have never doubted her, nor has she doubted me, until I gave her any reason to. So we went through an ""open relationship"" period when we first came to college, because we weren't sure if we should continue on with it. During this period, I walked a girl home who attempted to start making out with me, as a ""thank you."" I was extremely uncomfortable with the whole ordeal and never talked to the girl again. This was my extent of female interaction that has not been with my girlfriend. Whenever she would ask about the the ""open period"" I would say nothing had happened, because I was so uncomfortable that she would think that I had deliberately cheated on her, or something similar. Recently, this weekend, I finally got the gaul to ask her what she had done over that period. She told me a remarkably similar story, wherein a guy tried to kiss her, and she went back to her room sobbing. At this point I knew that I should tell her the whole truth. After telling her, she was extremely hurt. She has burst out at me a lot recently saying that I lied to her face. Which, honestly I have. Our relationship is now a roller coaster of us being fine, until she gets upset with me, for as she admits, no reason, and snaps at me. This is taking a toll on my mental health as well as our relationship health, and I'm worried I'm going to snap back at her, which would not be fair. I have admitted fully that what I did was wrong despite my best intentions, and I remind her every time. I've not gone out all weekend because I do not want to put her through the feeling that I'm going out and having fun while she doesn't trust me. Any feedback for this is appreciated. I'm really worried about us.

Long story short, I was dating this woman that I was really into for a while. Three months we were really good, really close. The following four months, there were difficulties. What she explained them as, I strived to be accomodating for because I really liked her. Found out later that I was the side piece all along. Went NC. Three months later, I was drunk and sent her an email wondering if I could get answers to some questions. No response until yesterday, where she said ""ask any question you have"" and nothing else. About a month ago, I felt I was finally over her and through most of my anger about what happened. I have literally just started seeing someone, and she's completely atypical for me, absolutely opposite my type. It's leading to a lot of self-reflection, and I'm seeing a lot of things from a different perspective. I do like her, but I am not smitten. I was absolutely smitten with the ex. I read this sub frequently, and if I said nothing else, I suspect that the highest voted comment would be to not respond. That's literally what everyone says, but I am not clear on why that's the ""common sense"" reaction. I will never be pulled back into her crap--the lies were extensive--but this is a chance for me to get some kind of clarity on the whole situation. It's a chance for me to get the most from that whole experience, to find out where/how I allowed myself to be decieved, and to find out what from that whole relationship was actually real. In short, I'm curious to hear from people who've had similar experiences with a lying ex, or have been the lying ex, and what decisions were made? What was the outcome? Would you make the same decison if you could go back in time?

He started dating a girl. I ended up becoming her friend. It was cool. We'd all hang out. I kind of fell off from him when they broke up because I liked kickin it with her. A couple months after they broke up, I texted him just to see how he was. I enjoyed talking to him and remembered why we did become friends. He was mad cool.

My good friend, of about a year now, has been a huge part of my life since we met and I've started to fall in love with her. She's beautiful, kind, and has a heart of gold. I've often dreamt about asking her out and being together, yet there's only one thing that's stopping me, and that's her sexuality. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge advocate for gay/lesbian couples, but I don't know if this girl could ever love me simply because I'm a man. I would hate to have her think differently of me, but I can't help but love her. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, what should I do? Would it be a good idea to let her know how much I care about her? Should I suck it up and simply remain friends? Please help! I love her so much, and I only want her to be happy.

Basically, my girlfriend and I haven't had sex in a couple of weeks mainly due to being life being hectic, sorting uni stuff etc.. The condoms ran out last time and we haven't had a chance to buy new ones. No biggy. Today she called, we were talking and it came up right ag that a condom fell out of her pocket or something today and her mom found it and made an awkward joke. I had to go so that was the end of the conversation, but it set off alarm bells in my head. She never buys the condoms. Its always me. And we have no plans to see each other this week, let alone today. So why was there a condom in her pocket? I've been cheated on before so its a bit of an insecurity of mine, so of course my mind jumped to that. I texted her an hour ago, immediately after the call asking in a light hearted fashion ""How come you had a condom in your pocket? We haven't had a chance in AGES :p"" and she said ""Dinner now"". That kind of bluntness isn't like her and she still hasn't said anything. *just got a text saying ""works not going great, talk later""* and its just eating me up.

The friend (M) is concerned for her friend (V). She said that they met at a concert and prettymuch immedietly started making out. She doesn't know the guys last name, where he lives, etc. and wants to sleep with him. I'd consider myself a pretty sex positive person, and if you wana do the do, then by all means. However, I can't help find it strange that (despite being legal, 17 in new york) that she'd be getting involved with someone 6 years her senior while shes so young. She doesn't have the best history with dating, and it seems destined to fail and potentially dangerous. I know it's a fuckload of 'not my buisness', but, can't help but be a bit concerned as I did work with V and know her a bit. I guess normally I'd try and say that people need to learn from mistakes, but knowing she has a history of sexual abuse and mental health issues, and the fact that it may just be flatout dangerous to her health/well being I can't help but be a bit concerned Being a 23 year old guy, I can say that yes, V is cute, but holyshit would it feel weird as a 23 year old to be with someone so young/immature and feel kind of concerned for the guy's character.

2 Weeks ago, my friend ""John"" admitted to my girlfriend ""Emily"" that he has been secretly in love with her. Not wanting to keep secrets from me she told me the situation and I had been mostly OK with it, and just asked her to be open and honest with me as the situation develops, and to tell me if he tries to do anything. On the *official*, I'm not supposed to know about these feelings of his. But today, I had a nightmare where she left me for John. And I woke up and told her about it and we sat in silence for a while. I asked Emily if she loved John. She swiftly said no she does not, but that she has some feelings for him beyond their friendship. And even though that is true, she loves me unequivocally. There was some crying and talking, she let me know that if it gets too painful for me that I could leave and she would understand, but that also both of their feelings would probably not go away. Honestly I'm at a loss here. 3 weeks ago we were in the most perfectly healthy relationship and now it seems as though we're on the verge of a breakup. When we met we fell in love hard and fast, and I can't bear the thought of leaving her. But I honestly don't know how to feel about this. My own insecurity, or jealousy, i feel, is going to end up tearing me apart. Has anybody ever been through this kind of situation? How did you help to resolve these feelings if at all?

My girlfriend has very few friends. They are all very busy so she doesn't get to see them much. I'm her only friend that she gets to see more than once a week. As a result, she doesn't like me having a life outside of her. She gets upset when I just want to hang out with the guys, or if I want to go to a interesting lecture (she hates lectures), or a conference (she hates conferences), or if I'm working on a special project. I am trying to start a business so I have many special projects going on. She doesn't see the point of me spending any time on it because it doesn't make any money. Well, no business makes money in the beginning. I have a part time job that gives me enough money. She gets really upset if I pick up a project to help out the community. She gets upset when I have a screening of a classical movie at my house, she hates classical movies. She also doesn't understand why I go through so much trouble to host events. I like hosting. I invite her to everything I do expect when I'm hanging out with the guys or working on projects for my future company. She just doesn't come because it doesn't interest her. We see each other 3-5 times a week and spend 15-30 hours a week together. She frequently tells me I don't spend enough time with her. I don't want to give up my life for her, especially because we only have been together for six months. She wants to move in but I think it's too soon. She doesn't like where she lives, I love where I live. I understand her problem but I don't know what to do. I introduce her to new people all the time but they never become friends for some reason. I love her and other than these problems, our relationship is great. We have many things in common. However, this problem is becoming very frustrating. It's frustrating for me to hear her say I don't spend enough time with her when I do my best to spend as much time as possible with her. I just need me time sometimes, I can't be with her 24/7. What should I do?

Apologies if there's any weird formatting, I'm on my phone and this is my first post. My parents were married for 28 years when my mom passed away unexpectedly last September. My mom was pretty much my dad's first everything. They met at work when he was 17, married when he was 21. They didn't have the typical go on some dates/courtship thing, it was more like instant relationship. She did everything for him and I wondered how he was going to manage, but he's making do. My dad is an introvert through and through, and he has that sort of self-deprecating humor or view of himself; he knows he's not Brad Pitt or a fascinating conversationalist. If he's not at home in front of his computer, he's at his one close friend's house hanging out or riding his motorcycle if it's nice outside. He still has my two sisters (24 and 13) living at home. Since early in the year he's been talking about dating, which to me seems a bit soon but that's not for me to decide I guess. He was talking to a woman he works with for awhile; they and another male coworker would get lunch often, and he would casually bring up going out sometime but she would always giggle and do the ""oh yeah, maybe"" thing - at least from what he said, that's my impression. After awhile he kind of got the message that she wasn't all that interested - they still go to lunch but without the talk of going out. I'm not sure how to best support him in this. A few months ago he asked for my (middle) sister's and my help with setting up an online dating profile and I haven't broached the topic with him since. I want to help him be happy but I'm not sure what to do. Honestly it scares me a little to think of him out on a date knowing it's probably one of the most uncomfortable things for him to do - in the way that I imagine a parent is scared for their child to go to school, maybe. Supporting my friends dating feels totally different than this situation - what can I do?

This may seem like a stupid question but please bare with me. Sometimes when I talk with certain friends of mine and I look at them intently, I eventually have to look away because I am uncomfortable with making eye contact because I don't want them to know that I think they are unattractive looking. So I have begun to notice that people also don't hold eye contact with me all the time and it got me wondering. Is that the most likely reason. I have a tendency to assume that others think the way I do and therefore I assume when others don't look me in the eyes it most likely is because I must also be unattractive.

As I approached my senior year, I knew I didn't want to get into a serious relationship with me leaving for college in a year. I figured I would just have fun with a lot of girls, and end it when I got tired of them. I started talking to this one girl who was a grade below me, and it was obvious she was the most beautiful girl I've ever had a relationship with. Our first date was significantly better than the others, and I felt an immediate connection. Around 3 weeks later we became official. For around a month I still figured this wasn't too serious and we would just have fun while we can. However, I quickly realized I felt something I never felt with anyone else. I told her I was in love with her, and she felt the same way. Now, four months into it, we do everything together, we have so much in common, and I can honestly say she is my best friend. We agreed to try a long distance relationship because we both can see us being together for a long time, and also she is most likely attending my college next year. This year, she is coming up to my college most weekends. We will see each other at least 8 days a month. My question is, is it wrong of me to ""throw away"" my freshmen year of partying and hooking-up to pursue marrying this girl, or follow my heart and stay with her?

I'll try to make it as short as possible, but I had a job as a computer tech making decent money. It was a good job, but I was in need of a little more in order to pay for college courses and help with my mom's medical bills. My manager was unable to give me higher pay. So I ended up leaving my job for an office job as a receptionist. Everyone in that office was terrible to me, it didn't matter how nice I was. The coworkers there always tried finding ways of belittling me, and the manager and owner were constantly mad over things that were out of my control since I was just a receptionist. Everyday I woke up nauseated and dreading the work place, I even fell into a depression. I stayed at this job for several months until one of the managers called me and asked if he can make me an offer to come back. The pay would be pretty much the same as this office job. I was so happy I took it in a heartbeat! My family and friends were supportive since they knew the desk job wasn't right for me. But the one I love, he isn't supportive at all. He got a little upset with me over this and kept asking why can't I find a job elsewhere. I told him because no other place would give me this pay. He's upset that I'm starting again in a couple days with my old job and just doesn't wanna talk about it. I've told him that I need to do what makes me happy too. He just hates the idea of me working at this place, and he knows it's in technology which is the field I love and I'm talented in. What's your advice? What else can I say to him at this point? Or do you guys fee that he has a valid argument? He isn't giving me reasons, he just doesn't want me back at my old job. Thank you all for your time.

Let me explain what I meany by my past. As a child I was emotionally abused starting at the age of 10 and ending when at the age of 16 but those years still take a toll on me. I'm not afraid of people at all but it's very hard for me to become emotionally attached to people because of this. I'm still very self conscious about myself but I don't let it show and I have a very hard time trusting people right away. In no way am I sad or bitter though because I tend to have an upbeat attitude and am a very outgoing, optimistic individual. I've had relationships before but more than not I was treated like garbage in those relationships, especially my last one when my ex would sometimes physically strike me as well as well as continue saying things like ""you know you can't leave me since no one else will ever love you."" I always told as a kid that I was worthless and useless and that no one could love me anyways so I just assumed this was all normal. It's been about 3 years since that and I still feel the toll it's taken on me but I've been talking to this woman recently for nearly a month and things seem to be getting pretty serious between us. She's cute, sweet, funny.. she's pretty much everything I'm not used to. And that's what's killing me. It's really, really hard for me to get emotionally attached to her because of my past and that's definitely not fair to her because she's treated me so well. I wish I could say I was joking when I say this is the first time I've actually been treated this way but it really is. She knows nothing of my past at all because I didn't want to reveal anything that might scare her off. When would be a good time to sit her down and talk to her about everything I've been through and how it might be hard for me, at least at first, to become emotionally attached and how it might take time?

I've known this guy we'll call Dave for probably six years now and he's been one of my closest friends for the past two years. He's had a rough time lately, due to losing his gf of a few years from her cheating on him and several other issues have just made him down in the dumps and extremely depressed over the past year. We decided to go into leading a MMO guild together around August of last year and it kind of exploded into a lot of members. Everything was going fine for the first month or two but we started losing members because people couldn't stand Dave's attitude, my own boyfriend included. He gets very worked up over things and can be abrasive a lot of the time when we're in the middle of activities. In general, the attitude when we play together is not happy and there is a lot of tension that builds up. I put up with it for a long time because it didn't bother me as much as it did other people but I'm in the situation now where the group is falling apart due to the way he acts. And he cannot see it at all. We have almost an entire group of people refusing to play with him now and if he enters the group, arguments start. But he still can't see the issue. I tried being honest with him a week and a half ago that a lot of the group just cannot stand his attitude and the way he acts. He seemed to take it to heart at the time but its a week and a half later and its still the same. I can't figure out how to be nice but be honest with him about the general opinion of him, and say that I have that opinion too without losing him as a friend.

So I know, I know. Cute things have to be thought up on your own. I've got a lot of them, trust me. But I wanted to know, what does everyone here do when they're in an LDR? It's getting to be spring semester, it's gonna be rough on everyone, and I want to make sure she knows I love her. So far, the list of ideas/things we do consists of (some will be missing, cause I have a horrible memory) Skype dates, handwritten letters, the florist knows her address by heart, takeout ordered to her room when she's had a horrid day, texting her pictures of the dog, calling her at night before bed, snapchat, talking about her class, homework/analyzing her readings together, my day at work/discussing my school, discussing theology, sexting, looking at sex toys we want to invest in eventually, discussing our opinions on apartment decorating/location, dog training, judging peoples' outfits via snapchat and text. I'm debating getting her a grazebox subscription, recently picked up a Creative Cloud subscription for us to share, and other than that am kinda out of ideas. She's a super high achiever and stressing herself out left and right atm. We're working on healthy stress management/positive reenforcement/self-talk strategies, too, because her standards are exhausting. So hopefully over some time that will help her stress levels.

I've been interested in this girl for quite some time now(We'll call her Anne, because that's her real name) but I am only recently starting to want a make a move. As a teenager I obviously have no experience talking to women much less people as I don't exactly have a way with words. The girl in question is in 3 of my classes and we don't usually talk, nor do we sit close enough to start a conversation. In the halls she usually goes the opposite of my way getting to class and never goes to her locker, instead just class to class, followed by her friends, so I can never get her alone. Even when we walk across each other I freeze up and can never say anything, or even look at her, which is mostly my fault and I'm trying to fix that. However, we do have play practice together but, again, she is surrounded by friends and we have no parts together (unless its dancing with the entire cast). Basically, how can I start a conversation with this girl? I'd like to get to know her better, even if it takes baby steps. I know this is probably teenage problems but I can't ask my parents since they will (and have) belittle me about it. I'm comfortable talking to girl friends but initiating conversation with a girl I'm interested in and can never have time to talk during class is a whole other thing. I'm willing to share more information if more is needed.

First time poster here. So.. Today I went swimming at a mates with my boyfriend. We've been together for about a month and so far he's got the idea that I've had a bit of a shitty past, but I haven't told him about my previous self harm issues. This is a really nerve racking thing to talk about and the need to tell him is there, but I don't know how or when to start talking about it. I don't want to scare him off! Anyway, we went swimming and I'm fairly certain it was hard to miss any scars I've been trying to hide. I wouldn't be surprised if he's already seen them, and that does nothing but heighten the anxiety of admitting it. Its taken so long to work up the courage to go out into public without pants or stockings on, which ive only done thrice so far, and the last thing I want is to make him uncomfortable. How do I achieve this Reddit? D:

like the tile says, I have been seeing a woman I used to work with for about 3 months. I had told her I had feelings for her previously, and we have been kind of casually dating while sleeping together, but it has been decidedly slow and casual from her preferences. I got a text from her last night when I knew she would be drinking with some of her girlfriends she is a bridesmaid for. Her calling me a loser even when she is drunk kind of destroys my romantic feelings for her, at the very least. I don't want someone who I'm potentially interested in thinking I'm a fucking loser, even when she's drunk I don't know how much slack to give this lady. I haven't responded yet, she apologized this morning like I said, but my instinct is that I should drop her for not respecting me. What do you guys think?

Hello reddit, it's been two weeks since my relationship ""fell apart"". Here's the thing: We've known each other for three years now and we've been a couple year and a half, we have an amazing relationship, we try to never lie to eachother, we ate together, worked together, it was almost like living in the same house. Her family loved me and so did mine. She always was searching me, telling me she loved a lot, hugging me; however, a few months (3) ago she started acting odd (gradually)... She was acting distant, some times avoiding my kisses, being a little agressive towards me, and other times she was normal. I noticed this so I talked to her, she started crying saying that she doesn't know what was happening to her, she said that she needed some space to understand what was happening to her but that she just loved me too much and that she did not wanted to hurt me and raise walls in front of us. This crushed me, I went to see a therapist to keep me stable, she said (the therapist) that I could probably be giving her too much (Which I did). I must admit that she was taking me for granted. The next day I talked to my girl... We agreed to be separeted for a while (I gave her until december) for her to decide what she wanted to do. In this two weeks I have rebuilt my lost friendships and keeping my mind in other things to avoid depression, and yes, I want to get back together, she has changed my life.

Okay, so this is sort of a dumb question. But anyways. It's my birthday today and I couldn't care less. It's just another day of the week for me. My family has always been big on parties. My parents are divorced, so it was always ""who can throw the bigger, better party for rundagger's friends"". Now that I'm out of the house, it's turned to ""who can do more with rundagger than the other parent"". I moved with my dad across the country two years ago, and all I expect from my mom is a phone call later today to tell me happy birthday. But my dad and his family (remarried) want to do all this stuff for my birthday. I have tried before telling them that I don't want to do anything. I just want to sit at their house, grill out, hang out, watch a movie and maybe eat cake. I don't want anything special. My dad and his family threw a party for me over the weekend with all my relatives that live nearby. Okay, cool, I can dig it. It wasn't anything special, and there was no cake. Even better. Yesterday I got a phone call saying that we're going out to dinner tonight, and to look nice, yada yada. Good thing I didn't have plans to sit at home and binge watch Breaking Bad with my boyfriend. My dad then went into guilt trip mode and told me all about how he was looking for the perfect gift for me and went to eight different stores to get it. I'm not the sort of person who likes getting gifts. I'm assuming that there's going to be another get together this upcoming weekend too, disguised under 'my birthday' party. How do I get them to understand that I'm not into all these party things? I've tried explaining it to them more than once, but each year it just repeats again. Do I just suck it up and chalk it up to my family loving me? (Also, yes, this is how everyone's birthday is in my family.)

Hey folks, throwaway account here as my social circle is very internet-savvy. I am a vet 23[M] going to a university. I am being lightly pursued by a fellow student, 20[F]. I do not know why. She's not really in my social group, we see each other in passing(had one class together ages ago). The few girls I was interested in shot me down (gently) so I've resigned myself to a mostly celibate college experience. Therefore, I act in a genial manner to everyone but keep to myself at all times. I'm worried I'm seeing something here because I want to see it. I'm worried if I follow through I will be seen as a lecherous creep. The only other relationship I've ever been in I broke off because I was ashamed I didn't have a car and the girl lived a couple towns over (and had to pick me up and drive me home). Due to this, I haven't developed any sense of body language ques if a girl is fully interested or not. I feel like I'm stumbling blind, and that if this girl who seems interested actually is, she'll be put off by my timidity. For context purposes, I am extremely self-assured if I know the nature of my relationship with people. That is why this is troubling for me, I don't know how she feels and I don't want to collapse the waveform by asking a question in a socially insensitive manner such that she feels uncomfortable and breaks what might be the first genuine human interaction I've had in 3+ years. How do I proceed? Should I ask her to accompany me on activities I normally perform myself (hiking, shooting, running)? How do I formulate a litmus test sort of date where I know how she feels, whether this is a friendship attempt or a romantic gambit? We've had dinner already, and I stumbled over my only compliment to her.

So I know its a bit weird. You start a new relationship, you want to tell everyone about it, right? Been with my SO for a few months now and I think we're moving from being casual to actually being in a 'relationship' (he hates labels so I'm not actually calling him my boyfriend atm... It's early days so I'm cool with that). Prior to him I was very much single for a long time and met some cool people along the way. Since I started seeing my SO I obviously didn't really speak to them and we kinda became exclusive. However now we're a bit more secure I think there are a couple of people that I got to know, that are kinda ex's you could say, who I would want in my life as friends now. The problem is I don't want to lead them on when I say 'lets get back in touch' but I don't want the first thing I say after a while is 'hey, long time, I'm in a relationship now, you good?' These were more along the FWB situations so normally a 'lets hang out' lead to more too... That's obviously not what I'm after, but I'm kinda wanting the friends part of that dynamic back... Don't want to lead anyone on when I ask to hang out though this time... Is there the right time/way to tell these friends I'm not available anymore? Or do I keep them at bay after telling them straight?

Hi everyone! I have been with my boyfriend for two years now and overall, it's been a good relationship. We have one ongoing issue (probably a non-issue to most but I just wanted some advice) about my hair. In the first few months of dating, my boyfriend and I were talking about kinds of looks we like and I said I had always been into red heads like him etc and he said I wasn't his type ( I have long dark brown hair) and he preferred blondes with short hair (basically exactly what his ex-girlfriend looked like) and I didn't think much of it because most people have a type and that's obviously fine. Then, he would often make jokes about me getting a bob hair style (above shoulder length cut so fairly short: the style his ex-girlfriend had) to the point where if I mentioned getting a hair cut, he'd ask if I was considering a bob. He would also point out others who had the hairstyle and say how nice it looked etc. At first, I just brushed it off and laughed and told him I didnt suit it when I had one when I was younger and thus wasn't planning it on getting it again. Eventually, I started getting slightly more annoyed when he made the comments, saying its my hair and I can decide how I want it etc and I don't want one. However, I keep feeling like I should get one to make him happy and to stop his comments but last time I got one,I just didnt like it and so have kept my hair long. I have also told him if he likes the hair style so much, he should date someone with it etc and he just pouts and insists he wants to be with me. Also, might be over reacting her but it's slightly starting making me feel like he wants me to look like his ex and I just want to look like me. He never comments on my clothes except saying positive things etc so it's weird he making comments about my hair so much. Basically, am I being over dramatic and even if I am how do I get him to stop without seeming like I am being over dramatic.

Yesterday, she told me she was under a lot of stress because her parents call her everyday because people tell them we are still dating and stuff and wants to have the talk. Also, we started having problems a few days back.

My fiancée (Sarah for stories sake) and I have been together for a while now. No major issues whatsoever. Before we began ""officially"" dating, there was another guy, we'll call him James, that she was torn with. I'll admit, I knew they were talking at the time, but I decided to continue on and attempt to make a connection with her. Boom. We clicked. A few weeks later, I asked her where she stood with James. She made it clear that she wanted nothing to do with him and that I was all that she wanted. Great! A month later, I went out of town for the weekend, and during that time, we talked on the phone and texted constantly. Things seemed normal. As soon as I got back in town, Sarah jumped into my arms hugging and kissing me. A week later, I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes. Time passed, and it brings us to the other day. Sarah told me that, while I was out of town, she went to the bar and got pretty drunk. She admitted that she gave James a handjob and he fingered her in return. I was devastated. Sarah made it very clear that she was just drunk, that no feelings were involved, yada yada. Is it right for me to be upset at this? Like I said, we were exclusive, and it was clear to everyone around us, but hadn't made anything official just yet. I forgive her for it, but I can't get that picture out of my head. She doesn't think it was very wrong, but I do. Did she cheat? Can I trust her?

It didn't take long before we both had all the feels and it became so great. She's even called me her boyfriend a couple times even though we have never full out said ""Yes, we are official.""

So, basically I (guy) have been talking to this really great girl since January. We've never had a DTR because we've been really bad at communication. It's taken alot for both of us to open up to each other at all because of past stuff. We're getting better at it, really! I really adore this girl and I'm pretty sure she likes me too. I'd like it to become more serious, but with both of us in school soon, I don't want to get into some unnecessary semi-ldr stress. She just got her wisdom teeth pulled out today and she's having a really rough time. I really want to send her flowers (this would be the first time I've done so. I've sent her small things but nothing big.) We haven't ever talked about flowers before. I just trawled through all her blog posts, twitter and facebook (as well as I could) but I couldn't find anything about her saying what her favorite flower was. * I know she likes flowers. (so yeah, no need to worry about that) * Purple is her favorite color. * Something kind of romantic and sweet but obviously nothing like roses. * Money isn't really a factor, but I know I want to get them delivered asap so that will probably need to be taken into consideration. * Where's the best place to get flowers?

My boyfriend and I have been dating for four years. He is not always the most socially aware person but he's a good person and I know he cares about me. Nonetheless, he tends to be a bit distant from me sometimes and it hurts my feelings. Yesterday was our anniversary. We are in his home state staying with his mom for a short vacation. We went out to a concert with friends two nights ago and then decided to drive back to his mom's city a night early instead of staying to see another band. This meant we would be going to see one of his favorite sports teams on our anniversary rather than going to a concert (which I personally would enjoy more) or out to eat. I'm not a fan of this sport but I've gone with him to games before and I don't mind going, nor did I mind going this time. Nonetheless. He treated it like any other day. Barely talked to me (we went with two of his friends, a guy and his fiancée). I paid for a lot of our food and such because I wanted him to have a good time. I even bought him a jersey as a gift. He was thankful but still aloof. After the game we went back to his friends' house to hang out for a while. Around 11:30 I asked to come back home since we had been up til 4am the night before and I am now pretty sick with a cold. He seemed irritated and made me wait another hour. This morning he got up again at 8 and left to go watch soccer with his same friend, so I've been laying here trying to not be sick. I guess I feel disappointed. I'm not asking for much. I didn't want a gift and I didn't have a problem going to the game or hanging out with his friends... It just would have been nice if he told me he loved me or something? Right now I feel pretty unloved and kind of like crying, but I'm sick so I can't tell if I'm overreacting. Help?

I broke up with him after 8 months of dating because it didn't feel like a relationship as much as it did a friendship. The sex wasn't great (very routine and boring, as he was closed off and said no to trying new things) and we grew less and less affectionate as time went on, and I just felt like he deserved to find someone who would love him more. I know I hurt him when I broke up with him, which makes me feel like shit. It hurt me too, because he was my best friend and we got along super well. Knowing that breaking up probably meant losing my best friend made it hard on me, but I also feel like it would have been selfish of me to keep him around just because I liked hanging out with him. How do you get over the feelings of guilt knowing you hurt someone who you care deeply for? All I want to do is text him and ask him if he's doing alright, but I think that would be a bad idea. I'm waiting and hoping for him to contact me and hopefully we can continue being friends, but I don't know if that's also me being selfish.

Let me start by saying, my boyfriend is a great guy. It has been a rocky relationship but time and time again he has proven that he is willing to put all the effort that is needed to make things work. He has helped me became a better person, helped me get over a lot of issues I have had with myself, and has always been there for me. He is never cheated, and is very open and honest with me. He's an frequent Reddit user so I can't really go into specifics, but incase he does fuck it, it'll be a nice reminder to him how much he means to me. So what's the problem? Well to give a bit of background my parents divorced when I was little, not only that but for some reason I was mostly surrounded by unhealthy relationships. I don't dwell on it much and have never thought it affected me. Sometimes this irrational fear comes over me that he must be fucking me over, more specifically that he is cheating on me. I have no reason to believe it other than I can't tell who he occasionally texts. And so far the times I have figured out, it's just friends or family. It's completely ridiculous. Just certain situations or thoughts trigger this overwhelming feeling that he must be doing something wrong. There's very little I can do to shake it off. I must emphasise that this is mostly comes from me just over thinking. I want some advice on how I can get out of the habit of thinking this things, or dealing with this insecurities. I know this could be something that ends our relationship and I really don't want that.

My girlfriend is 21 and I m 20. We've been together for a year and things have been wonderful. We started having sex by the 3rd month, and it started out great (in my head) but I noticed she never initiated and was never actually interested, and asked her but she just kind of ignored the question. I tried doing things differently but it didn't help. We have been in long distance for the past 4 months and have 2 months to go. Different countries, not cities so no visits. In this time I learned much about her and her issues with sex. Now my girlfriend had a rough childhood and was raised not to trust anybody including her mother and father because they have been emotionally abusive and neglectful. As a teenager she didn't date because of the way high school is in the United States and how often guys are just taking advantage of girls and vice versa and all her friends had bad experiences. So according to her she just ""shut that part of her brain off"" and now that we are together much has improved on both of our ends. She loves and trusts me much more than anyone else. The problem here is that she gets nervous talking about sex, or even approaching it. She feels nervous every time she mentions it and feels bad for having those feelings and its getting in the way of things for us. For instance, I suggested we just have a virtual shower together and she was just nervous beyond anything, and could barely get a grip on herself so I decided to give her space. She never says anything about me in attraction. I sincerely just want to help her and don t care if we don't have sex again for a while as long as I can help her get past this and truly enjoy herself, cause she is a wonderful person. What should I do? And what might be the reasons behind this anxiety and stress about the subject. P.S. We were both virgins before this relationship and its our first serious one.

I'm 23, horrible at flirting, never had a gf, blah blah blah. NO idea how to flirt. I've asked several of my friends and they all pretty much say that I should be suggestive. So I sent a girl (probably 20-ish), who's number I got a week ago, this: ""So you don't have work today and I don't have work today. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? :)"" Because women love smiley faces right? ...Right? She responds with ""I'm at work pal. I close, but it's nice to hear your off. I hope your enjoying your day off. I'm going back to work from lunch."" Asked a female friend and she says that the girl was obviously NOT happy with my text and that I was being TOO suggestive...upon review I got the same feeling. So after lurking for a couple years I decided to make an account to get a consensus on how to flirt.

So recently our friends who have been best friends finally started dating. They are absolutely perfect for each other and it has made me look at my relationship. 90% of my relationship now is sex. I'm not the one initiating. Every time we see each other she has a tendency to start things and i have no idea how to say no. I don't mind it but its to the point where that's most of what we are and I hate that. I always wanted to be in a relationship where we would talk and discuss and laugh with sex occasionally. And there is the second problem, whenever we discuss she seems offended by a lot of what I say. It's as if me having a different point of view than her treason. And another main issue is with me. I have terrible self esteem. Not to the point where its crippling but it is pretty bad. I get jelous easily. Her best friend is male and that makes me worry as I see these other 2 best friends finally dating and how perfect they are. I worry I'm not that for her. Honestly with all the issues recently I have been thinking about ending the relationship but one thing is holding me back. I'm not attractive or at least I think I'm not and I worry that if I leave her I may never find someone else. I know it sounds dumb and its super easy to say ""There are plenty of fish in the sea"" but it's hard to believe. Advice?

I've known my friend for 3 years, and we briefly had a thing once during our second year of friendship. Things didn't really come to much and I got clingy and messed things up. I ended up repairing things between us, and we're pretty close friends now. I see her on a fairly regular basis but we only get to hang out about once a week. Most of our time together is one on one, nobody else around, but occasionally we're at her house with her family watching movies or whatever. We're going to prom together (as friends, with other friends) but I want to still take pictures and dance with her and stuff. Hopefully that can still happen, but it wouldn't be a romantic scenario. I still have feelings for her, and I want to act on them despite knowing it's a bad idea. I really want to try and make something of it but I don't see a good outcome from it. I'm about 85% sure she doesn't share my feelings for her. How should I go about this?

Fellow Redditors i need some advice, I have been talking to this girl from work for about 2 months. I got her number and seems pretty interested. she said she liked me, ""like a crush, i think your cute and funny""; however, she said she has no time for a relationship (she works two jobs and says her friends are really important). I invited her to a date with me and she said yes, but flaked on me because she said her nephew was turning one. It bother me a little, i did not tell her anything, i just said next time. I told her today where we stand and she said she cant do a relationship but thinks i'm funny and says she really likes me. I feel she is putting me on the back burner. I saw her today and she said we are just friends. So what is your advice? I think i know to let her go, but i just need someone to see it from outside my perspective. What should i do? Should i keep texting her and make her laugh at work? or back off?

It has been a little over 2 months since my ex GF broke up with me. We almost never fought during our relationship and didn't have a big blowout at the end. Our problem was that we moved way to fast and nearly spent all our free time together. The first 4 and a half months were incredible and we became deeply infatuated with one another. It seemed like everything was going great and then out of the blue she told me she just became a little burnt out. She discussed with me how we could make things better, but then 2 days later she ended it and crushed my heart. Now 2 months have passed and I've started casually seeing another girl, but still can't get my ex off my mind. Which isn't fair for anybody. This new girl is super sweet and I really do like her a lot, but I can't help but think about my ex sometimes. I also have reason to believe my ex may have started seeing another guy but I'm unaware of the severity of the relationship. So I guess my question is, should I try contacting my ex to see if she has any feelings for me still, or just leave it be? She meant so much to me and became one of my best friends and I hate having her out of my life completely. I know I said that I started seeing someone, and I do like her, but we both will graduate in June. I don't know if I should put too much of my heart and effort into a new relationship? I think we both realize that this may just be short term anyways.

I recently found myself having feelings for another person and quickly removed myself from the situation well before anything happened. While this other person does bounce around in my head, I don't really believe in these kinds of attractions. I see it more as a possible reflection of something else that's wrong. Looking back, I'm seeing how my marriage feels much more like a friendship than a romance. I do believe that this happens with many people, though, and keeping high levels of attraction or passion isn't realistic or probably very healthy. Overall, our relationship has been very steady and we've worked through lots of life issues together. The biggest issue we've had is codependency (more so on her side) and relying on lots of things. Through our marriage, we've taken large strides working on these issues, though, and she's become capable of taking care of herself at least monetarily and physically. Looking at our relationship now, I'm wondering how much of my own depression and anxiety has been affected by the relationship itself. We've rarely done things independently but things have changed and I'm experiencing a little more freedom. I've never ever thought about leaving before and not sure why I can't shake this feeling that it's going to happen. I can barely make conversation with anyone anymore and feel like a zombie walking around without seeing anything. I'm stuck in my head with these thoughts constantly rotating. I don't know if my wife would ever emotionally bounce back from a divorce. I'm her first and only real relationship and I don't know if she's really ever grieved despite some large losses in her life. I don't know what I would honestly gain from leaving other than being alone.

I love her more than anything, and she just broke up with me this morning. Until the semester ends I have to see her for three classes a day. I really don't know what my plan of action should be: No-contact is not an option What I had with her was probably the best it could have possibly been considering how short the relationship was. I've known her for two years, and have been harboring a crush on her for an extremely long time. She blew away my concept of love completely. The relationship didn't wither and die. We went from 60 to 0 in one day. 16 hours before it happened I would have never expected this. **At all**. In her words, she got some ""good advice"" and realized that she ""doesn't have the mental capacity to handle a relationship right now"" and she has also mentioned that I need to be able to support myself emotionally before I can support others emotionally. She's right, fundamentally I have kind of fucked up priorities in my life. I'm absolutely destroyed right now and all I want to do is to sob into someone's arms. And for the longest time the person I would have run to was her, and now I can't.

I'll call him Buddy. He isn't a bad person, but he omits and exaggerates information to an unnecessary extent. Between me and multiple of my associates, Buddy tells different versions of stories on many points that make it hard to pinpoint his actual events and motives. He's a wannabe people pleaser. I don't mean that insultingly, he'll reflexibly respond affirmatively to anything without thinking details. (e.g., he asked me to hang out the next day at my place, I said yes. A little later, his brother called about Buddy going to his place at the same designated time, and he immediately said yes in front of me. Buddy didn't bring it up after that, this happens often) The thing is, he clearly doesn't mean to do what he does. Still, that doesn't erase that promises become falsified, claims fall through, excuses are default, and reliability is out of the question. I put aside a lot of days to hang or do otherwise, and he extends times and often just cancels, usually without even informing me. It's also what he does to himself, like not getting his license or a job when he makes plans to, and he takes every cop out or excuse he can think of. The troubling thing is, Buddy seems very unhappy with himself. He can't pinpoint why it happens or really comprehend/integrate explanations when they're given. He has been given a plethora of sound advice in the past 3-ish years that he's had better influences of associates, and he always acts out ""epiphanies"" that are apparently forgotten and/or repeated later. I'd normally consider this behavior that of a lost cause, but I'm compelled to believe this is an exceptional case. My manpride holds me back from saying it, but I care for the dude. I don't know what to do, I'm still demoralized and disappointed often, and feel guilty for feeling that way.

I had been seeing this guy for about six weeks and I was falling in love with him. I've never connected with anyone like this. I know it's a short amount of time, but I just can't explain it and I know he feels the same. Then last night he told me he had cancer. I don't want to say what kind because I don't want him to recognize this, but he's been in remission for three years and the only reason he told me was because he thinks it's back. He's got a doctor appointment scheduled to get a biopsy. He's terrified, as you might expect, and he says he doesn't think he wants me to stay with him - not because he doesn't want me, but because he doesn't want to start anything he can't finish. He doesn't want to leave any ""loose ends."" When we got together it was supposed to be a casual thing but it quickly became much more than that for both of us. He wanted a distraction, I wanted something fun while I figured out what I wanted. I found what I wanted. He's afraid of distorting my memory of him. He's afraid to really let me in. He's got complications and baggage other than this that he hasn't shared with me because he says he never expected we would get this close. He had a child and a wife at one point. I don't think they're around now but I don't know what happened. I am scared of losing him. I'm scared he won't let me in. I'm scared he will suffer alone to protect me. I want to be there for him, but I told him if my presence is making his life harder I would walk away at this exact moment. All he had to do was say so and he didn't. We're supposed to meet this week and talk about everything. How do I explain that I want to be there for him and that he means the world to me? How do I get him to understand that whatever happened before won't matter to me, all that matters is who he is today and what he means to me?

I met this girl, we'll call her Susie, in my theater class Freshman year (2011) And she completely captivated me. She was the first girl I've ever looked at and thought not that she had a nice ass or nice tits, but I looked at her and went, ""Wow. Shes beautiful."" She honestly wasn't the prettiest girl in the world, but she was to me. As petty as it seems, if I had to pick one girl to spend the rest of my life with and I can't even look at another women, it'd be her. She was in my life for a month, and she moved. Now, fellow redditors, I had cancer and cause chemo I have terrible fucking memory. I mean, I don't remember anything in my life until my freshman year of high school bad.. And even then it's very fuzzy. But when it came to her? I remembered everything. I remember her voice, almost 4 years later not having heard it. I remember her beautiful singing. I remember her cute little laugh. I remember everything. I've tried to have relationships and I've tried to move on, but I can't. We never even dated - we never even kissed, and I can't get over her. I've tried telling other people, and they always tell me it's hormones and that they had the same kind of deal. I don't believe them because their situation is always different.

My partner [30f] and I [35m] are getting married next week in a very large Italian type wedding. We've been together for 2.5 years. I am not a frequent drinker, perhaps once or twice during the month but I am always in control. She has asked me not to drink at our wedding. When I asked her why, her first concern was that I would always be at the bar. The second concern was that I would be drunk off my mind. I told her that all my guy cousins and immediate uncles would want to share a drink with me. It's just a cultural thing and out of celebration. I told her that I would be in control and if anything, I would just be having fun with a light buzz and keeping everything in balance. Just having a damn good time with my family and hers. It's a family wedding and my cousins would love to have a drink with me. She is pissed off. She says I don't care about her. She took off the ring and said she won't put it on until she is convinced that I care about her. She even went on to say that I don't care about her and didn't do anything extra special for our engagement party which was 3 months prior. She also said that it being our wedding party should make me happy enough and that I don't need alcohol. I think she is being waaayyy overboard and extreme about the drinking bit. I don't appreciate her reaction either. Overall, I told her: 1. I don't want to get shit faced piss drunk. This is not my intention. Thoughts? Am I being insensitive?

A little background, my girlfriend's an athletic chick who likes to work out often and maintain her figure. I knew her for two years but we've only started dating 4 months ago, we were your usual happy couple exploring things together and one day we decided try out birth control pills as we wanted to do it without a condom. That was the turning point where the side effects of the pills (mainly the increased weight) started to kick in, and I was totally oblivious to it. Not noticing it, I continued to ask her to take her daily pill at the scheduled time. It's been a few weeks since she stopped the pills, but she still has the extra weight on and she bloody hates me for it. We've talked several times about this and every time she would that she hates me and that my pills ruined her life. The most recent message had her saying that she did not want to ever see me again until she feels like it and that she was in a good mood until I messaged her. Thing is, she's currently in her exam period and I'm causing so much problems for her (she told me she cries because of me and what I've done, when I messaged her). With the immense pressure from the upcoming examinations and her confidence being rock-bottom because of me, I feel extremely useless, selfish and stupid. I think I'm a horrible person. She mentioned of giving herself a break and starving to get back her body because it's the only way to get it back during this time frame (due to examinations) I'll give her a break, stop contacting her for now, but what should I do when the situation's cooled down and her examinations are over?

I have been dating this girl for a few weeks so far, but I'm not entirely sure where it is going. I think we work well together, and I am honestly fine whether she wants something serious or casual. Slight preference to something more serious since we match up so well though. However, I can't really figure out what she wants. We haven't had sex yet, we have only kissed. Which I am fine with, I have not tried anything, since I want to do it 'right' and she also seems to be a bit apprehensive about it since she doesn't want us to move too fast. At least, that's the vibe I am getting. So that makes me think she's looking for something serious. However, some other things make me thing she wants to keep it casual. She every time says that we are just hanging out, she invites me to a bunch of things with her friends (guess you can see this as both a good thing and a bad thing) instead of trying to make one-on-one time. We still hang out just the two of us, though. She also says it takes a long time to actually like someone and hasn't been in a serious relationship for two years. I thought about asking her flat out ""So where do you think this is going?"" but I'm not sure if I want to do that so early on. I just mostly want to know if I should start opening my heart, or keep it shut. So how would I go about that? How do I find out what she wants/what do you guys think her angle is?

For the last half of a year, every time I try to talk to her it's only when I begin the conversation - it's been like this for almost every day as well. We talk, then after about a half hour she stops talking to me when we finish discussing about a topic. It's a long distance relationship - I'm a college sophomore, she is a HS senior. I decided to experiment what would happen if I suddenly decided to not FB message or Skype her, and for the last two weeks she's only talked to me twice: both about prom related stuff. First thing was about the dress she got, I comment, no response. Second thing was the forms I needed to get approved, I comment, she comments, I comment again, no response. Hasn't said anything about me not talking to her. The other night I also ""drunk texted"" her a ton of texts (ok, I didn't really text anything, all my other friends who were plastered got a hold of my phone and started texting her cutesy stuff that somehow sounded like me). She just responded with a picture of her dress. (This was before her first facebook message to me, a few days after I started this test). I think there's another guy involved too. Apparently there are rumors of her hanging around with another guy and people are saying she is getting ""too close"" with him. Now since it's high school I didn't think much about the rumors (such as her holding hands with him) since high schoolers are high schoolers + some of them don't think it's anything to be worried about, but I addressed my concerns anyway and warned her not to always be with her. I had even confronted her about this and after a lot of tears... we had agreed for her to stay away. Yet I ask my sister again and they are still with each other just as often. My brain says something is up. My heart is hoping that the brain is wrong. IDK what to do anymore.

Hi Reddit! I just want to know if I'm being unreasonable in my demands, or a suggestion on how to mediate this and come to a conclusion. My boyfriend (lets call him Dan) has never wanted to get married, but isn't particularly against it. He just thinks it's pointless, but has revealed that he will get married if it's important to me. However, when I mentioned that I wouldn't want his name, he got really hurt and upset that I wouldn't take his name. I don't want his name because honestly, I think it sounds stupid. It's a target for getting bullied in class should our kids have his name. I like my name and I don't even want to double barrel his name in. He doesn't know this though, he thinks that it's just my name meaning a lot to me. He has said that if I won't do something which means a lot to him (taking his name), then he doesn't want to get married. He thinks he's already done quite a lot for me (he's vegan because of me, although I didn't make him vegan I didn't want non-vegan things in the house and he has respected that). However I suspect that he's only doing this because he wants me to do something for him which I don't want to do, rather than something he particularly wants. Kind of like 'Well I'm doing this thing I don't want to do, why can't you?'. Our relationship isn't in peril or anything, I'm very happy with him and we're planning to have children soon (he's even agreed to raise the kids vegan!). I'd just like an outside perspective.

Look I'm not proud of this but after talking with her and reading all of the reply's out there I did something that I'm not sure I regret or regret not doing it sooner. I used her ss# and did a criminal background check on her. (yes I used my work place's service for this, again not proud but I did it) Let's just say that if I had an old printer I would have used reams of paper on it. It didn't show any of her juvenile arrests but there were a shit ton of arrests and several more that she didn't tell me about. We've talked btw and I told her then to just tell me everything so I wouldn't be blindsided again. She doesn't know I ran this btw. She said she told me everything. However when I view her record she certainly has not told me everything and there is one thing that I am going to confront her about and this now has me doing the pause in where I stand with her. Honestly I don't know how our car insurance isn't through the roof. Her license had been suspended multiple times and oh btw she had a conviction for DUI causing bodily harm (how that is not a felony I have no idea). But the one that hit me in the gut was for solicitation. My understanding of that is that this is prostitution. I've seen online that it can be trying to get others to willfully commit a crime so maybe this had to do with the drugs, I'm not sure. I know that people are going to scorch me on this but if this was for prostitution I think that is going to be it for me. No matter if it is or isn't I'm not happy with her at all right now as I gave her every chance to be honest with me the other night and she didn't tell me about the suspended licenses, the bodily injury or this solicitation. I feel like I'm getting trickle truth here and I don't like it one bit.

I have recently discovered that my boyfriend is a compulsive liar. I came to this conclusion after catching him lying to me about very petty things. I'm good at catching when people are dishonest, because my father was a compulsive liar and emotionally/verbally abusive. I know all of the signs of compulsive lying like the back of my hand. Unlike my father though, my boyfriend does not always lie on purpose and sometimes isn't even aware that he's doing it. I discovered this with my boyfriend and he immediately came clean. We talked about it at length and he told me that lying was a way to protect himself from his parents and that it just developed into a habit over time. He has been actively trying to work on it. He feels bad for lying, knows how much it upsets me (he knows about my father), and has been really open about everything. We plan on attending therapy (couples and individual), but at the moment, it's not feasible, so in the mean time, we've just been working on it by ourselves. We've been busy reading a lot of literature on compulsive lying to educate ourselves about it. Even though I trust that he's wanting to/actively trying to fix this, I still have lost a lot of trust in him due to his past lying. It wasn't even anything big like cheating or something that would make me consider leaving him, but lying is lying, and I already have trust issues because of my father. I want to be able to trust him, because he's the sweetest guy I've ever met, would do anything for me, and we love each other a lot. Can I ever truly get over my trust issues and feel that I'm able to trust him, if he's able to overcome his lying habits?

She and I have been together for 5 years. There was a time (~2 years ago), during which, whenever I got drunk I would occasionally throw fits of jealousy, or scream curses at her (no physical abuse). Most of the time these bursts were unjustified. During some of my escapades(~7 in total) a good friend of mine would sometimes comfort her, if she got too upset. She broke up with me about 2.5 weeks ago, stating that she probably didn't love me anymore and that she felt this way for quite some time. We handled it quite amicably. During the break up I asked her whether she had feelings for my friend, to which she responded ""I don't know"". A few days ago we were discussing some practical matters when she dropped this : ""If he were to make a move on me, I'd seize the opportunity and get with him"". That sounded devastating. In my opinion, it would be very low of both of them to hook up/start dating, if only because we haven't even been separated for a month, and that would crush me (selfish, I know). Oh, and my friend is in love with her, and has been, so he will definitely make a move. * Should I try to find out if anything happens/happened between them? * Am I completely wrong in thinking that it's low of them to hook up, knowing how that would make me feel and given the small amount of time passed? * If something happened, I'd have to stop seeing my friends, since said friend is the center of our group (yes my ex still hangs out with our friends, since she doesn't have any of her own).

The following is why I want to get back together: -I miss him -He's said he could stop messaging others/commit if we get back together -I don't know if I'll ever find anyone that I'm that connected to Is this relationship worth retrying on? Help. I have mixed feelings.

Hey guys and gals, So recently, within the past week, I broke up with my girlfriend (20)of almost 10 months. We had a pretty good thing for the most part but I (20) could't continue the relationship due to sexual reasons. So I broke up with her and she took it pretty badly at first, but after around 2 days she seemed better about it and we smiled and talked and laughed with each other like we used to. Now, one of my fears is that I haven't given her enough time or space to get over me properly. I know she's a big girl and can handle herself, but we were each other's first true love. So I think it may be harder to get over me than I realized and I'm wondering if I'm making a mistake by continuing to talk with her so soon after our breakup. I've told her my fears and how it may not be a good idea to talk and what not but she didn't seem like it would be an issue. But now I want your opinion reddit. What would you do?

Ok so same dude (mentioned in previous post) got into a discussion & he brought up how my ex used to tell me I wasn't good enough & that I was lucky to be w him etc & so I asked if that was his reasoning too for not wanting to be intimate w me anymore. Well, he proceeded to let his temper rise & started angrily telling me how it's just the opposite...that I'm TOO good for some guys especially too good for him cuz he's selfish & can't/doesn't appreciate me & that any guy who comes across my path is a lucky man etc etc & how I have a huge heart, always thinking of others & so on. Soooo I don't effing get it! Is he genuine? Or is he full of shit? When I think about what he said, it makes me feel like he had/has feelings for me even though he denies everything. Am I crazy for thinking that way? If not, wtf is his deal? I don't necessarily think he's playing games as he's fairly blunt & his actions/words are good, but then again being FULLY AWARE of how I feel about him, he tells me earlier how some chick he used to hook up years ago randomly msgd him & they reminisced & gonna meet up soon as he gets back outta state which is prob within the month. I'm so sad. I need to let it go.

So I think I may have gotten myself into a bit of a mess. I've been seeing a guy, let's call him Andy, for a few weeks now and things are going good between us. He treats me so much better than any guy I have dated in the past year. We get a long really well, he is kind, funny, respectful of boundaries, and is interested in getting to know me. It's made me realize how bad the guys I dated before were for me. There is one problem though, and I'll fully accept the consequences if it causes things between us to go south. Here's a little bit of back story: I met him through his roommate (Patrick,26) which I used to have a pretty big crush on. Over the past few months I have been going over to their place to hang out with all Patrick and all his friends as a way to get closer to him, but during these events I didn't really talk to him at all. I was always playing darts with Andy and talking to him and a few other people at the parties. About a month or two ago, I ended sleeping with Patrick even though I knew he wasn't interested in dating me. We were both pretty intoxicated and haven't brought it up since. I continued going over to his place because we are still friends. During another party I got really intoxicated and ended up making out with Andy, and we've been talking nonstop and hanging out since then and like I said things are going pretty well. If things get serious between us, I feel like I should tell him about what happened between Patrick and I because I wouldn't want him to hear it from someone else or think that it was anything than what it turned out to be (NBD).

So a quick background. Both me and the girl I'm seeing have had relationships in the past where we both just kind of dive right in/love at first sight kind of a deal and this time on our first date 6 months ago we said we want to take it slow cause she just got out of a 4 year relationship. We both are very different people (me: scorpio, her: gemini) and it shows very much from family background to life experience. However when we hang out or see each other at least once a week we have tons of fun and I introduced her to new experiences. FYI we have no slept together. The most is peck on lips and holding hands. So my issue is that it seems I put a lot of effort into things like making the plans for the date, making sure her birthday is flawless, lots of surprises, giving her career and life advices, making food and everything for her. In short, I make her very happy but once in a while I do upset her because I tend to be very intense with questioning. Once in a while she would want to make the plan to see me. She's hesitant on me meeting some of her friends (I've met one Best friend) and it just sometime doesnt really seem like she shows interest. So I'm not sure if shes just stringing me along or if this is what it means to take it slow because I honestly don't know what that terms mean. As of now I'm not sure whether I should just stop chasing her or just endure the process of this taking things slow.

I don't want to write a wall of text here, but basically since my sister was diagnosed with her laundry list of mental illnesses (bipolar disorder, eating disorders, social anxiety, depression, and so on), she's turned to me as her main target of her frustration. If I get up for seconds at dinner, she throws her food down and says she's not gonna eat anymore, making me feel guilty for her restricting her food intake. If I want to watch something on TV in the family room and she doesn't like it, she will say something very hurtful to me, throw something, and so on. I've tried talking to both of my parents (both in their mid-50s) about this, my father takes the ""she's mentally ill she can do whatever she wants"" kind of route with handling her. He does whatever he can to keep the peace with her, which means he just tells me to ""shut up and take it."" My mom is a little more understanding, but she still blames me for all of the lashing out my sister does at me, even if it's unprovoked (99% of the time it is). It's getting to the point that when she sits down next to me I feel that she's going to claw my eyes out, I don't feel safe or welcome at all, and I just sit in my room most nights to avoid her behavior. I'm still a student and work part-time, and can't afford to move out, and for the rest of the summer I have to live at home before university starts back up again. What can I do to deal with this situation?

I am separated and will likely be divorced. My husband and I have been together since I was in college and I literally feel like I have no idea how to date. Everything is online? God I feel so old saying that. I know Tinder is mostly for hookups? I'd like to go on some actual dates, but am not looking for anything serious, just want to start meeting some people. But having sex with someone, I don't know at this point. I was never much into casual sex (serial monogamist here) so that thought terrifies me too. I really have no idea what the best way is to go about putting myself out there a bit. I'm generally pretty attractive, decent body type, so I get attention from men but dating...?? Ugh.

I have a very good friend who is in an open relationship, let's call her Sara. She is married to a man, but they have an agreement that allows her to sleep with women as long as she asks for permission from him first. She is not allowed to sleep with men. I'm totally fine with this – every relationship has a different set of guidelines and expectations. Whatever works, works. The issue is lately she has been very aggressive in her pursuits of bedding women. I'm a lesbian (Sara and I actually briefly dated in high school) so I have a lot of friends in the LGBT community. Once Sara finds out that one of my friends is into girls she then proceeds to ask for ""permission"" if she can sleep with them and usually ends up doing that. Additionally, she often makes sexual comments about our past sexual history in front of others. My best friend is straight, and she is even constantly making sexual comments about her and her friends… whether they are straight or lesbian. Yesterday, she basically asked me if it was ok if she hung out with my ex-girlfriend for the sole purpose of sleeping with her. I have no issues with polyamory or open relationships, but I'm starting to find her behavior very disrespectful and I feel as if she is becoming a liability to hang out with. It's to the point that we have to warn our friends in advance that she might *try* to sleep with them. Am I over-reacting or is she sort of out of line here? I spoke to my best friend about it and she agreed that Sara is being a bit disrespectful, but we are not sure if this is just because we aren't too familiar/comfortable with the swinger lifestyle. She is the only person we know in an open relationship. Reddit, what do you think?

Keeping this brief. My gf started taking anxiety meds not too long ago, and as a side effect, it killed any sort of sex drive she had. I mean, KILLED. We have sex once a month, if I'm lucky. Now, I plan on marrying this woman. She's simply perfect, no other way to put it. However, she hasn't really talked about getting therapy for her anxiety, and sees the meds as a solution - for now anyway. But if I'm marrying her, I don't know how long she's planning on staying on the meds. She's a very busy person and has very little time for individual therapy. She could be taking the meds forever. I simply don't know. She doesn't appear to know either. I have to be honest - if I'm marrying this woman, I am NOT excited about the prospect of having sex once a month for the rest of my life. We've talked a bit about it now and she's apologized, but there's nothing she can do if the pills are killing her sex drive. She said if I *really* want to, we can have sex anytime and she'll say okay. But I have to be honest, having sex with someone who isn't in the mood and is very difficult to get in the mood is very, very unsatisfying. I've tried talking her into taking therapy so she can get off the meds eventually, but she works incredibly long hours and is tired often, and is simply not interested in any long-term help. Yet. What do I do from here? I really don't want to end the relationship over something like this, but this is getting to be really frustrating. I haven't masturbated this much since I was single. I understand she's taking meds for her issues, but I feel like a dick for compromising what we have because we don't bone more often. Any help / advice? Anyone been in a similar situation?

Gf and i have been dating for about a year. Things have been good. July 3rd we leave for road trip to east coast. It's great, were excited and happy. July 7th, while she sleeps I look at her phone. I had a suspicion she was messaging someone through this game. Open up game and there's a 20+ game record with her ex. Open up games and messages read: ""Hello handsome"" July 5th ""We should have a make out session"" ""I'd love to have you on my boat"" ""I dreamed about you last night"" ""We should meet up soon""... ""Yeah we should"" With other shit in between. July 5th we were in NYC and having a blast.. Truly romantic in my eyes... A perfect day together. She sends that shit. July 8th were on our way to Philly. I open up the game like I'm bored. Ask about ex in the game and start looking at messages. She snatched phone away and deleted app... Saying it's just her text messages. After arguing she says she still has feelings for him (broke up 2+years ago!) She denies anything remotely physical or flirtatious happened, I know she's lying (about flirting). She made a legitimate effort to tell me she was so so sorry (for what? Cheating? Thinking about cheating?) and she wants to be with me so much. She seems sincere... Do I give her a second Chance, or kick her to the curb? Help please!

Honestly, I've always had this problem with guys. I'm not typically a shy person but for some reason I can BARELY look at a guy when I'm attracted to him. I've overcome about 95% of the situations that normally trigger my social anxiety, but I haven't quite mastered talking to crushes yet. Eye contact is pretty much a no-go and I even find it difficult to speak normally. The guy that I'm currently interested in is very attractive to me, and it just makes it difficult for me to look at him/talk to him without feeling self-conscious. I feel like this either makes it extremely obvious that I'm interested in him, or it just makes me seem standoffish. Neither of these things are things that I want. I'd really like to be able to be my animated, talkative self around this guy, but I can't stop feeling extremely self-conscious whenever he's looking at me. I so badly want him to find me appealing, and I suppose this causes me to be over-aware of every little thing about myself. I want there to at least be a little bit of a chance of him being attracted to me as well, and I highly doubt that's going to happen if I keep acting like an awkward mess around him. Any advice? _________________________________________________

We have dated for over a year now and my mom never really liked him. She would constantly told me to break up with my boyfriend. When she found out that we were sexually active she flipped out and constantly harassed me to end it.( I come from a conservative Asian family. She thinks I am a whore now.) My mom and I have always clashed because she doesn't understand college life (She has never experienced it.) I was harassed by her so frequently-- eventually she told me if I don't break up with him she was going to cut me off and disown me as her daughter. My family is important to me and I didn't want to cause my mother anymore grief and stress. So I told her I would break up with him. I love my boyfriend and we are important to each other. He understands and knows my stressful times at home but doesn't know I told my family I'm not with him anymore. I don't know what to do because my mom doesn't trust me and asks me if I'm lying to her. However our relationship is much better and I have a happier home to return to. (I live near campus but home is about 40 minute drive away). No one else knows of this big lie. I haven't told any friends or my boyfriend. I know I should tell him but I fear I will hurt and anger him for not standing up for our relationship-- but I just can not win my mother. She seriously believes I have tainted my reputation and my body. I can be paranoid about my mom finding out but that comes and goes. Convincing my mom is not an option. I just got off the phone with her and she threatened to me that if she finds out she has been made a fool of she will never forgive me. I wish she could see that what I do is normal...

Okay, so basically. Me and this guy have even sort of seeing each other/FWB (note that we're exclusive: think 'together but not together' we basically do everything that couples do except say we're a couple). And when I mentioned just saying we're in a relationship he said no because 1. We're getting the same thing out of a relationship so it doesn't matter (from my view: it's not that different for him but for me it's the stability of what we have and it's knowing that he wants to commit) 2. If I'm not happy with how it is, I wouldn't be happy in a relationship (from my view: it's different in a relationship? - this is the only thing I'm unhappy with) 3. I'd get bored and find something else to moan about instead of this (from my view: this is the only big problem I have with him so I don't see what I would get bored with?!) 4. He would have to check in with me if he wanted to do things with his friends (from my view: he doesn't do that now so why would I expect him to?) This has gone on for about 3 months now, when we first had the discussion he said 'let's agree to disagree' meaning that we did what he wanted and I figure that I've been patient and tried it his way (he doesn't seem to acknowledge that the constant rejection actually upsets me) and he keeps saying 'it could change' but that doesn't seem likely at all. And I just don't know what to do anymore - my friends just say to get rid of him (I don't know what his friends say as they don't know about me) but I wanted impartial opinions :)

I'll try to keep this decently short. My girlfriend and I are at a great spot in our relationship; however, at 9 months in I'm starting to notice something that probably isn't a big issue to most but it is something that kind of matters to me. One could say I'm the romantic type, (flowers, surprises, letters, that sort of thing) not every day but about once a month or after maybe an especially bad day I'll do something like to surprise her. She loves it. I also am the kind of guy who will make the extra effort to see her, or go out of my way to do stuff like pick up something at the store she needed on the way over or something. The problem is that she does absolutely nothing of the sort. She tells me she loves me and is great when we hang out, and is really an amazing all around girlfriend, except she doesn't really ever make any effort to surprise me, or do anything special for me (she didn't even get me anything for christmas, even though I let her know I was getting her a few things). She even talks about stuff she wants to do with me, for Me, or get me...it just never happens. Or if it's kind out of her way or inconvenient she will just not see me or expect me to go to her most of the time. I guess it puts me in a mental bind, I love this girl and she does everything expected of a girlfriend, is it fair to be upset that she doesn't go above and beyond? I guess maybe for me personally those things aren't above and beyond, but *are* expected. Should I bring this up and talk to her about it? I don't think it's a deal breaker, but it makes me feel like I may be more into this relationship than she is. I don't really know how to address not getting what most people could consider just extra benefits in a relationship, I feel like I would sound like a whiny child if I told her that. I also want to end this with saying that this is literally the only flaw with my girlfriend. I really do love her and she is absolutely amazing in every other way.

When we started out, we made it clear we just wanted to be FWB. It was fun, the sex was good, and it's simpler than dating. We never even explored the concept of dating because we felt like the timing was wrong (both very focused on our careers) but the implication was that we were fundamentally incompatible. There were times we tried walking away, wanting to see other people. When I tried to, he'd start becoming really sweet and playful. When our attempts at dating failed, we just go back to before. A part of me thinks maybe those relationships also failed because we wanted to continue... or not. who knows. Recently, he made a comment about a colleague of ours being pretty... and that annoyed me. I thought it was benign until I noticed we were doing it less. One day, he just blurted to me that he wants to try and ask this other girl out. That broke something in me. I've been unable to sleep since then. I can't stop thinking about him. It doesn't make much sense. Sex is good but not passionate. We don't cuddle or hug. It's almost transactional. But, he is a good-looking, nice and intelligent. He has been there for me through some tough times. I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I just scared of losing something good? Do I really feel anything for him?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 10 months. A few months back we suggested that our siblings should hang out, as they are in high school and have similar interests. My sister is 16 and my girlfriend's brother is 15. About a month ago my sister was diagnosed with an immune system disease that she has to take chemotherapy drugs for. Some mornings she is nauseous and doesn't make it to her first class or two. She has missed a ton of school and some days she kind of milks it and will just skip the entire day and go out to eat. My girlfriend's brother pointed this out and started telling their friends that she was milking it. This lead to a fight between them and they have been firing back nonstop. My girlfriend's brother has said stuff about my sister and lashed out at her friends. My sister is definitely not innocent in this case either. Her and her friends have said some really mean shit to my girlfriend's brother. They're spreading rumors that he's gay, they tell people he sells drugs (high school lol), and they have all around just ruined his social life. He doesn't really have any friends left and is in a pretty shitty place emotionally. My girlfriend is livid as she cares a lot about her brother. She understand that hes not 100% innocent but she has texted my sister and said some things that could have been a little over the line, however I don't really disagree with what she said. My girlfriend no longer feels comfortable coming over to my house because of my sister and what she has said to her (my sister told my mom). What do I do in this situation?

Okay, so to begin with my boyfriend and I have been together for a year now. We met in highschool and were close friends, and then began a relationship once he graduated. I'm still in my final year. Okay, so when he finished he was really unsure what to choose, but ended up choosing a film school in the city, which I thought up until now he was enjoying. Last night he couldn't sleep and told me he was really hating it and was unsure what he wanted to do with his life. As a back story, my boyfriend has depression. He plays a lot of video games, and when he sees his friends (who don't go to college or have jobs), they play games too. Now, I don't have a problem with this, I too play games, sometimes with him as well. I don't mind this hobby he has, but sometimes it feels like it takes priority over school. We talked through it last night and I told him I would support him 100%, no matter what he decides. He sais the idea of maybe doing IT would interest him, and I said that sounds like a great idea. He plans on talking to his family about it, so he can have their opinion. Now, I know in my heart I will support him no matter what, but I'm worried. He doesn't really have anything he's super passionate about, and I'm a very driven person. I plan on going to university to study business, with aspirations to open my own shop front. He doesn't have this drive - but I believe he has the potential to. What I'm asking now, is what do you guys think about the video game situation? Should I talk to him about it? Also, do you have any advice on how to help him choose something, or guide him in the right direction? I really love him and want to support him through this.

I had been crushing on her for a while but then became focused on other stuff. Recently, however, we have taken more interest in each other as more than just friends. We study together a few times a week and sometimes go out on weekends together. We have even hooked up on a couple occasions.

This would be my first real relationship if we chose to become exclusive or even the more daunting ""Facebook official."" If this were a few months ago, I would not think twice to go for it, but now the end of the semester is only about 5 weeks away. This means I'm going to be extraordinarily busy with exams and projects until the summer. We're both going back to our respective homes for the summer, which are about 4 hours away from each other. I'll be working full time this summer and she plans to as well, so we will both be busy. Overall, I think we would both like to move forward with our relationship, but my doubts come in with it being so close to the end of the semester and whether or not I'll have enough time to put into the relationship. Also, once the semester ends, distance becomes an issue. I'll appreciate any advice. Thanks!

My fiancée is an absolutely amazing woman. She's a hard worker, funny, happy, pretty, takes care of her body (works out, eats healthy) and she absolutely adores me. We have the same sense of humor and we rarely have serious arguments. She's not even materialistic in the slightest; she's as good as a person can get in my opinion. So why am I not attracted to her physically? It's weird, cause I think she has a stunning face and body, but whenever we start to get intimate, I have a hard time focusing and desiring to have sex. We're getting married in a couple of months and I'm having real anxiety and depression over this. I even started seeing a psychiatrist and taking antidepressants, but even though my mood has increased, my desire to have a sexual relationship with her hasn't. I've had my blood taken to the lab a few times, and everything looked good except my testosterone. I took testosterone shots for months and even started working out heavily, but there was no improvement. I am emotionally exhausted by this because it has been going on for a while. Reddit, what have you got for me?

My boyfriend [23M] and I [21F] are thinking of moving in together at some point in the near future. We have been together 1 year and friends for about 5 years, so we know each other reasonably well. We are both quite introverted and are wondering if there is anything two introverts should know when going into a shared living arrangement. For starters, we've agreed to have two bedrooms so that each of us can have our own space. We've also agreed to give the other person notice if one of us brings friends over. We're still talking about how to make sure each person gets enough downtime. Is anyone who has been in a similar situation able to share some perspective?

I met a really cool girl at a party right after Thanksgiving, and we've been out on 2 definite dates, plus had dinner and lunch pretty frequently. Since it was the end of the semester, I haven't done anything physical with her at all, except for giving her a friendly hug every time we split paths. I know she is interested, mostly because she never really wears make-up, but every time we make plans to see each other she always does her hair, puts on make-up and does her nails. It's break now, and even though I know she's interested, I want to stay in contact and try and keep her interested until next semester, when we can actually spend more time together. We texted a lot at school, so I'm not worried about that. I just want to know what kind of level of communication of appropriate for how long we've known each other. Should I aim to text her daily, or is that too much? Is it appropriate to call her and wish her a Merry Christmas? Any fun ideas for things to say/text her to keep her interested while are away from school for a month?

Situation: My sister, 26, is getting married the end of this year. I have no clue what to say for my speech during the reception dinner. Background: I am very happy for her and everyone is on board with the guy. Families have met each other, and they've been together almost a decade. It's not like I do not know the guy, I know him in a sense that I know what he's like, I've hung out with him. For the last 6 years, we've lived separately. Me in North America, she back in Asia where we were born and raised. It made it difficult for me to be close to her, or get to know her boyfriend to a greater extent. We were close growing up, puberty to teenage years. We were so comfortable with each other taking selfies and other playful stuff. Then at some point, for some reason, we kinda strayed. No bad bloods no ill feelings, but we weren't as close as we were before. Chalk it up to growing up and having different priorities and interests?Again, the last 6 years (we've seen each other a few times during this period) didn't help. Assessment: It makes it difficult for me to come up with an honest, touching brotherly speech when the day of the wedding comes. We were never the type to hang out with each other's friends when we got a little older. Recommendation (what I think): Part of the speech will include memories of us as kids, part of it will also admitting that the last 6 years of not being around each other didn't give us the best opportunity (maybe come off as humorous?) I feel ridiculous because all weddings I've been to it seems like siblings have the beat stories of the bride/groom and their partners. Help me out?

At this point I have been seeing the same person for four months, and we recently had an argument about where our relationship was going. Some background: we knew each other for a year before we started dating, and four months ago we got involved romantically. We were always pretty straight up and consistent with each other, no games whatsoever. We see each other 3-5 days each week, and when we are not together we are texting and messaging each other to keep in contact. The relationship is ideal as far as both of us are concerned - we never fight, there are never disagreements, the only issue is that he does not want a title for what we are. He says that he has been in long relationships most of his life and he wants to focus on himself and get his life together right now. I respect that; however, my argument is that he is ALREADY involved with me, whether he calls me his girlfriend or not. We are not seeing any other people, we spend most of our time together, we even have towels, toothbrushes and other odds and ends at each others houses. I am not asking him to change any of his behavior - I am happy with how often we see each other, how we relate emotionally and sexually, and everything else. However, I am not willing to continue down a road with someone who just told me that he does not want to be my boyfriend now, or any time in the near future. But since telling me that, he keeps texting me and wanting to continue to see me as often and under the same terms as we have been. My question is, am I fighting a losing battle? Does he simply not care about me? Or are there other things I should take into account? Should I draw a line in the sand, or be more understanding?

We recently went on a family vacation, and we (me and my siblings) agreed to foot the bill for our parents, but split equally among us three. However, my siblings both seemingly don't want the full amount from me. They say things like, ""Oh, forget about it"", or ""You can just pay for ______ while I pay for ______."" If we were to do it this way, our individual contributions would be roughly proportional to our household incomes. Yet I feel uneasy about this. On the one hand, I do make the least money and it's kind of great to not have to pay as much (I'm pretty frugal and wouldn't have chosen the more expensive accommodation options). On the other hand, I feel like my siblings' spouses don't particularly like me, or even see me as a mooch. I've always been the baby of the family due to being significantly younger. I also feel like I haven't balanced my debts, like I will still owe them something, or that my brother-in-law or sister-in-law will grumble, ""Why are you still paying for OP's portion for ________""? They sometimes pick up other small things, like lunches and dinners, that I have done with less frequency, because we have family things at their houses most of the time. If I try to insist to pay them, they get kind of angry. What should I do? What's fair?

I think I already know what I need to do, but hopefully hearing it from you guys will make me follow through. Me and my bf live together and spend most of our non working time together and pretty much know where each other are when we're not together. Obviously there's always a way to hide where you're going or who you're hanging out with, but so far everything has seemed normal. Well I went out of town a couple hours away and found out my bf used a hookup app while I was gone. He sent sent and received all kinds of pics and exchanged explicit sexual texts. Right now I don't know for a fact that he met anyone, but he I do know for a fact he talked about meeting up. The thing is, I don't know if he was just doing it for attention or to help him get himself off while I was away since I'm not sure if he actually met. How should I talk to him about this? To be honest our relationship has felt kind of stale lately so in a way I wasn't even surprised to find all of this out. He still tells me he loves me and even said it while he was using the app. I can understand wanting attention but getting it from a hookup app is very sketchy in my opinion. Can't he just find porn?

I don't know if this should be in a health related sub or if this sub is fine too, feel free to redirect me. So, we've been together for almost a year now and we have ""adult sleep over"" regularly. She sometimes has bad dreams but nothing special and nothing in particular triggers them and there's nothing fancy about them. Last Wednesday, we were both pretty tired and during the night she started having a bad dream. In her dream she was lying in her bed and the frame she has above her bed was actually a big spider. This is where it gets interesting. You know how when you wake up while in deep sleep you're a bit confused, very confused even? Well, she started calling for help in her sleep, like ""no no no"" in an anxious voice (I don't exactly remember what she was saying but it sounded like a cry for help, and I was in deep sleep so pretty confused). I of course jumped to help her and held her in my arms. I know it's bad to wake people up when they are in deep sleep but I was just reacting instinctively at that point. I took her in my arms trying to get her to calm down but instead I transformed the spider in her dream to a robber that had now caught her and she started moaning/crying ""who's this? who's this ??!??"". I was trying to tell her ""it's me, it's me"" but she lives not too far from an airport so she sleeps with earplugs, it took a bit more time than needed for her to understand. She then realized what was happening and calmed down. We then had a huge laughter for a good 5 minutes as I was explaining to her what happened and she was explaining how it went for her. This is the second time something like this happened, the first time she literally moaned ""help, help!"". Now I know the good thing to do would be to let her calm down on her own, in her dream, but as I said it was pure instinct guiding me. Do you guys have any advice that could help me in this situation? edits: typos

Hey everyone... I met my girlfriend of about 1month on match.com and she is fantastic. She gets along with all my friends and is just everything I'm looking for. The problem is we met online. My friends and family think that is an embarrassing way to meet (every time a commercial advertising it comes on, they insult it and say how embarrassing it would be to actually use a site like that...) I have been telling them that we randomly met at a starbucks, and just hit it off which isn't necessarily a lie but feels pretty damn close. I actually met her online and our first date was in the very public starbucks to get to know each other. I don't know how to break this to my friends and family that I actually met her online and my girlfriend is getting upset because all of her friends and family know the truth and thinks that I am embarrassed about her. My question is, how do I go about doing this without risking the validity of my relationship to my peers and family?

Essentially my female friend and I moved in to our new houseshare and met the 4 guys we're living with on Saturday. On Tuesday morning I left for work but 5 mins later realised I had left my laptop in my room. Got back to my room, opened the door, and my new male housemate was in there looking in my wardrobe and touching my clothes. He had properly shut the door behind him so it's not like he had just popped his head in to have a quick look at the room.As far as I can see he hasn't taken anything (or left anything). I flipped out and yelled at him while he scurried back to his room, 'What the FUCK are you doing? What went on in your head to make you think that was ok?' etc. He started brokenly stammering 'oh ..er...your door was open..I came out of the shower...I', then fell to his knees shaking and running his fingers through his hair just saying 'I don't know, I don't know what I was thinking, I can't explain it, I'm so sorry'... I rang the landlord and asked for a lock to be put on my door, and he agreed to that and said, 'Wow...ermm [ awkward chuckle] ...that's a bit embarrassing isn't it... yeah I'll look into the locks for you, I know he smokes a lot of waccy baccy but we've never had a problem with him.' Then later the housemate came downstairs crying saying that he had told his girlfriend and parents and that he was arranging to see a counsellor. A handyman came and installed a lock on my door the next day, so I feel much more comfortable in the house now. I am just really interested to get some opinions from reddit on this. So far everybody I've spoken to agrees it is really weird, and personally I am finding it really difficult to be civil to the housemate, as it really freaked me out and he still doesn't seem to be able to explain his behaviour.

It happens in the morning on the locker room. Our locker neighbor each other but we never talks because I didn't know him as we are in different section and I rather keep my time in locker room short. All of a sudden he yell at me saying to respect my elder and let him go first. From the situation I judge that I may open my locker to wide and it obstruct him from his locker or something. My first instinct is to apologize as I may be in the wrong eventhough I'm not sure what it is. Thinking nothing of it I continue to change but he suddenly talk to me with a strong voice asking where I'm from. He uses a very informal and rather rude form of ""you"" in my language and judging from his voice he probably is angry. I told him where I'm from and he says people from that area are usually polite. He continue to talk while walking outside how I'm still a fledgling but already impolite and disrespectful. It happens really fast and out of nowhere that all I can do is smile and say sorry in a casual way. Now thinking about it I'm really angry. What do I do to deserve that? I may have done something wrong but I promptly apologize, why do he need to make a spectacle out of that? I'll probably just stay silent and try not to make a big deal out of it. But I wonder what should I do if he provoke me again because we meet each other everyday in the locker room. I try not to make enemy as I'm rather new on the company (barely 6 month), while he already work there for 15 years so making a big deal out of this will probably result in nothing other than satisfying my ego. My coworker on my section advice me to just stay calm because maybe the guy has a bad day and just use me to vent.

I [17/F] recently started dating a new girl [20], and she's really great. She's the first girl that I've dated for longer than a month in a long time, and I see no signs of slowing down. I'm actually in a honeymoon phase, as opposed to some of my previous relationships where I only really liked the attention I got and very rapidly lost interest after we were dating. Everything is great as far as my girlfriend and I are concerned. But about a year ago I had a nasty breakup with my first love [18]. We were together for three years, started dating young (from middle school into junior year of high school, so we had that young person growing up together bond going on), were conjoined at the hip and best friends, the whole nine yards. Even though everything is going perfectly well with my new girlfriend, I can't help but be afraid that it's going to end in a horrific crash just like my relationship with my first girlfriend did.

-Sorry if this is a little stream-of-consciousness- I recently met someone I really like- the aforementioned 22M. We have nearly all of the same interests, the same sense of humor, and a satisfying sexual life. He treats me well, provides all that I felt I was lacking in my previous relationship, and we have a lot of fun. Sometimes I feel like I could be en route to falling in love. We've known each other for a few months, and started dating seriously about a month ago. Most of the time we're together, things are great. And then other times, out of nowhere I just feel unhappy. I dwell on our age difference a lot- I know that 22 is adult-ish, and he's mature, but *I* know that who I am now is a long, long way from who I was at 22, and I feel like we're at such different places in our lives and that we will be for at least the next 5 years. To make the divide seem even greater, he lives with his parents (he's a student), and they support him financially. I support this, as I lived with my parents until I went away to college (although my parents didn't support me financially, but then again they aren't as wealthy as my BF's parents). I've been trying to focus on having fun with him- love doesn't always come when you think it will, or in the package you think it will, right? So I'm trying hard to be open-minded, but I constantly end up dwelling on the negatives. He also has one of those baby faces, and sometimes I feel gross, like I'm making out with a high schooler.

My boyfriend and I have lived together for about two years and while I enjoy living with him I wonder whether he would be a good long term partner. The main issue is that he spends a lot of his time playing video games and redditing (and other interneting), which I find hard to respect. He is supposed to be doing school work by distance but it is taking him much longer than it should (1.5 years so far) because he doesn't focus on it. I think he might have actually given up on it at this point. When I ask him about it he says I'm nagging so I have stopped saying anything. He has money from his education fund so we can split the bills and that isn't an issue. My concern is for his lack of follow-through and excessive video game playing. I wonder whether this will continue to be an issue or if it's just that the distance courses are not very motivating. I feel that it's not my responsibility to push him to do his school work. I've been thinking that he might not be a good long term partner. I've been considering it for six months but flip flop between wanting to break up and wanting to push things with him some more. Our relationship has mostly been great so far and he has some very good qualities. I really like that he is easygoing and can quickly pick up what I'm feeling. There are a lot of positive things in our relationship. I would appreciate any advice on how to handle this. I'm unsure if this is a ""deal breaker"" for me or not. How do you decide?

Things aren't working out, our personalities aren't as similar as I thought, and we are on different pages. I've finally realized that I need to break up with him. However, I don't know when to break up with him. He does not know and I don't even think he suspects anything. I am going tor help him move back home from his dorm on Friday, spending Thursday night there as well. He is flying to California on Saturday until Monday to visit his brother [40-something/M] and his family, whom he hasn't seen in a few years. I don't want to break up with him until he gets back, because I don't want him to be in a depressed mood the entire time he's there. I just don't think that's fair. My mom thinks I should end it before he leaves, because a different environment might be good for him right after we break up. She has a point, but I really don't want him to be upset at all while he's visiting his brother. He really looks up to him and I know he is really looking forward to seeing him. I love him dearly and I care a lot about him. He makes me smile and feel giddy when I'm with him, but there are things that I know are wrong. This is going to wreck me and I even had a panic attack last night that made me sick to my stomach this morning because I finally decided that I need to end it soon. I don't want to do this, but I have to. (If any of you are interested in why we're breaking up, just ask and I will add it.) So..when do I do it? Of course I want the most time with him that I can get, I want to wait until he gets back, mostly because I am terrified of saying goodbye, but also because I want him to have the best time in California with his brother without any worries on his mind.

Okay, I have never been in a relationship before, but during middle/high school (I graduated in 2012), was one girl who I really liked and twice she acted like she liked me back, then as we would be talking, she would do a complete 180 and cut me off, insult me, etc. The first time she did it, I was hurt but I still really liked her, the second time was the worst. I had just suffered a fairly severe head injury, and this girl was, again, acting like she liked me and wanted a relationship (even in my severely impaired state) but we were still friends, until one day ,she again, cuts me off and quits talking to me. All that shit happened at the very minimum of 5 years ago, but it hurt me so deep that, after it happened I was so mad and so hurt, I burned every bridge I had that was a girl. I hadn't even thought about a girlfriend, until a couple months ago. There is a new girl, but I haven't even spoken to her (she's my sisters friend from college, so I hardly see her and although I have caught her looking/smiling at me more than once, I can't go say something, because I'm scared I'll get ""hurt.)

My SO is my best friend. I wish I could ask him for his advice, because I value his opinion and he's thorough in his thought processes. For obvious reasons, I can't ask him. So I'm hoping maybe you guys might be able to help. My boyfriend and I started dating at the end of senior year of high school, and have made it through 1.5 years of college long distance. Along the way, we have had some major fights, but I have never wanted to break up with him for a number of reasons. Most importantly, I really loved him. I think I was also afraid to break up with him, because I knew it would hurt both of us a lot, and because I rely on him and he relies on me. We are very compatible in many ways. In a nutshell, he's kind, intelligent, ambitious, funny, and thoughtful. He loves me deeply, and so do his parents and his sibling. My parents are less enthusiastic about him. They think he's a great person, but they fear he might not be the perfect match for me. He's pretty quiet and introverted (I am too), but they fear I might do better with a partner who makes social situations less anxiety-inducing for me (aka, someone who is a bit more talkative with strangers). They also worry I haven't had the opportunity to discover what true compatibility is, because he's my first real boyfriend. Recently, I've started to share their concerns. In some ways, it is the-grass-is-greener syndrome. But I think it also is a truly valid concern that he's my first boyfriend and I can't necessarily judge whether someone is a perfect match for me. I know he makes me feel comfortable and we get along really well, but I haven't felt passionate about him in a while. I also can imagine my life without him. I'm not sure if that's just because we haven't seen each other in a while, or if I'm ready to move on. I can't tell if I've fallen out of love or not.

I married a man I've known peripherally (1.5 years) after a month long whirlwind romance. We have a fantastic connection, lots of fun and have a lot to share with each other. I've never wanted to get married but deciding to get married to him didn't even feel like a leap of faith but more like a foregone conclusion. We spent a lot of time together in bars that first month but it felt celebratory and a bit like speed dating. I admit looking back now it should have been obvious, he drinks in excess, only really wants to hang out in bars and can become aggressive. He has never been violent but I know he's stronger and he punched a hole in the wall while yelling at me while I huddled in a corner yelling for him to go away. At this point I am well aware that I cannot calm him down or coerce him in any way once he starts. Several incidences have occurred (breaking my stuff mostly), my friends and parents have expressed concern and they all like him but things are out of hand. We've had a lot of hard talks that felt totally unsuccessful til I finally realized just what I was dealing with. We are at a point where I'm having to make ultimatums, if he doesn't get outside help and hold himself accountable I can't share my life with him. So the thing that I wonder, after reading a lot and talking to close friends...is it possible to have a happy relationship with someone dealing with alcohol abuse at this stage? My hope is that he'll go to therapy and AA and that eventually this won't be a constant issue but after reading all the advice it seems more like a false hope. I need advice.

I'm a Soldier deployed overseas and being so far away for so long caused me and my girlfriend to split up. She graduated college in the spring and needed to focus on finding a job. We tried being friends but I wasn't ready for it. I kept trying to flirt with her and push her towards being in a relationship with me again. It was hard for us to find time to talk because of the time difference between the US and where I am stationed and often I would get mad when she wasn't able to make time in her busy schedule for me. Eventually things blew up in a big fight last week and she told me not to speak to her anymore. I was devastated because I didn't see all the things I was doing wrong. I had accused her of being cold and no longer caring about me at all anymore but now I see that it was my unwillingness to just be friends that pushed her away. Her best friend was kind enough to break things down and explain them to me from her perspective and I now realize that I was being a total jerk. I just want to know how long I need to wait before I can tell her I have seen where I was wrong and am ready to be friends. I still hope that we will be together again in the future but I recognize that she isn't in a position right now for that to be an option. Even if we're not dating, she was someone very close to me and I miss having her in my life.

Before my girlfriend and I met last October, i was a virgin in pretty much everyway. She also has a high libido and so whenever we're with each other we tend to have sex like 2 times a day. She takes a BC pill and has missed it a couple times since we've been together and is pretty good about taking it within a two hour window each day. we've used a condom every time except like twice months ago(and I was freaking out about pregnancy). I know that using both forms of protection severly reduces the chance but am not sure how much irregularly taking the pill will mess with things. After I go home after a few days visit, I worry and can't wait until she tells me her period started(which i really appreciate her telling me) so I can ease some. How can I pretty much eliminate the fear of her getting pregnant? We have talked before about what we would do in case of pregnancy but what if she realizes she missed her too late? In addition to just worrying about pregnancy, I tend to worry a lot anyways about things.

My boyfriend left for europe on vacation 2 months into our relationship and told me he kissed someone while out partying on his trip. He told me it was a one-time, drunken thing with a stranger. I ended up forgiving him and we worked through the trust issues. Two years later, he left his facebook open on my computer and I (I know, it's bad) looked through his messages and found out that he had actually added the girl he hooked up with, and messaged her after getting back from his trip. However, they haven't had contact in over a year. He also told his buddy that he was really good at picking up girls in Europe, offered advice on how to go about picking up these girls, and that the area he was in had the hottest girls out of anywhere he'd ever been. In another message to a friend, I found a photo of him and another guy with their arms around 2 girls at a party (shortly after he got back from his trip) and he had captioned it ""I miss the days you could just pick up girls and not have it plastered all over social media."" There are no recent messages of this nature. Obviously this has upset me, and I know that I've made a mistake snooping. Our relationship has been fine up until now. How do I approach this? Do I just pretend I never found these things? I'm worried because he's returning to the same place in Europe this summer, and I'm afraid he will try to contact that girl again.

I am a 20 M, she is a 21 F. We both attend university, and are both in the same classes. We met about 6 months ago, at the first sight I thought she was beautiful. We started talking more and more in class and it was going great, come to find out she has a boyfriend! I was devesated, I started to have some legit feelings for this girl! Through more conversation I have found out that she is in an abusive relationship. The past few weeks we have been getting even closer then before, you have to realize i see this girl 4 days a week for 6 hours straight. Is she trying to hint that maybe she likes me to? Maybe she wants out of her abusive relationship? Or am I just having some wishful thinking. Lately she has been more touchy towards me, touching my elbow when we talk and laugh playing footsies. So am I crazy? Is there a chance she could like me?

My ex boyfriend of 4 years ago broke up with me via text 2 weeks ago. He just moved to a new city 4 months ago for a job he got out of school. In the text he said he got a job opportunity that will advance his career and that he needs to take this opportunity. He knows I wouldn't move where he was because theres no jobs in my field there (Ive joked about it before but he didnt even entertain the idea.) He said in the text that he did love me and knew he was being selfish. I was blindsighted, I had seen him 4 days before and everything was normal and great, we spent 4 days together. I guess he was just given the opportunity to sign the contract and we didnt speak for 3-4 days before he broke up with me. I kept texting asking how he could do that to me and a bunch of other sappy but not mean stuff.. he didn't even want to talk after and screamed at me for even wanting to by text. Next day he talked to me and said he thought it was the best for both of us, hes not ready to move in with someone (like we had planned) , and he doesn't know if he loves me. Im not sure if getting this contract made him realize all of these other insecurities. I felt like I needed more closure and he wouldnt even respond, I also texted him what he wanted me to do with the stuff that was in my trunk (things he left there when he moved in with me for a month ) and still no response. Why is he blocking me from his life? I told him I understand why we broke up but I still want him in my life. Its been 4 days since my last text to him. Since the breakup Ive been crying everyday but still being able to attend class and such..I do miss him alot. I know the relationship wont work with him having to be in that city for years and me moving in 6 months by myself now but I want him in my life.

Okay so we dated for a year, I found out she was using me to get close to my brother and then was cheating on me with him our last few months. We broke up, shes been out of my life for almost a year now. Do you ever fully get over it? I dont think about it as much but every time i hear about my brother I just get so fucking angry and bitter. When I get close with girls now i just dont really trust them anymore. I know im more mature and healthier and I don't get bedridden or depressed from what happened anymore, but I still have that nagging feeling from it.

My step-sister and I have never been close. She has been in trouble with the law several times, is a known meth addict, and constantly borrows money from my dad. Furthermore, she has become pregnant and the family is 99% sure her husband is not the father, as he was locked up around the time the baby would of been conceived. However, my step mother is the enabling type of parent, and sees nothing wrong with how she lives her life. Recently, after her husband came home from jail, they have announced the name of the baby. They are naming the soon to be baby girl Jenisus, pronounced like the book of the Bible. Normally, I would roll my eyes, but my step-sister begged the family for criticism. She wanted us to tell her what we really thought. Most of the family just enabled her, but I was honestly sick of her living in such a fantasy world. I told her that the name makes no sense, has no known origin, is hard to pronounce, and will cause social issues for the child. She definitely did not like my answer, and is now telling the family what a terrible person I am. Furthermore, my open criticism has sparked a fight between my step-mother and father. She wants him to make me apologize, but he has held his ground in requiring me to do so. In the interest of saving face and helping my father, how do I placate my step-sisters ego and still not seem like a wuss?

My grandmother died today. I found out when I opened Facebook and had messages from a close friend saying ""sorry for your loss"". My mother posted about it to Facebook about four hours before I saw it. No missed calls to my home phone or cell and no texts, she made no attempt to tell me in any way. I'm... Angry. Plain and simple. This is not the way any person should be given bad news. To be fair, we have known my grandmother would be going soon, its been a long battle with a dibilitating disease and short battle with untreatable cancer. But my mother and I have a close enough relationship that I was expecting a phone call at the least. I recognize that she lost her mother, and that she's in pain. Maybe she didn't want to call? So I texted and told her that I loved her and was thinking of her. She responds her thanks and tells me that she went out to dinner with friends and is doing well. So now I'm even more angry that she appears "" just fine"" and couldn't even bother to let me know what happened. I would like to say something to her, after an appropriate amount of time, to let her know that her actions hurt me and left me feeling unimportant to her. Is this a terrible idea? I feel rediculously selfish thinking of my hurt feelings when she just lost her mother. If I did something like this, how exactly would I go about it? What would I say? My other thought process is revenge and treating her as she treated me. My family has some news to share, I'm pregnant, and I'm ready to let her find out on Facebook rather than tell her face to face/in a special way as I'd originally planned. I'm sure that's just the anger talking but she kinda would deserve it. Alright reddit what do I do?

It happened when I was 19-21. I was never famous or very successful. I acted in a few videos by some studios and the videos are online. I can't take them off as I had contracts which gave the studio the legal right to the videos. They're on a couple of premium websites and a few of them are on PornHub and other free websites. They aren't super popular or anything and they are under stage names. I told my husband before we got married and showed him the videos. Nobody else knows on his side of the family. It has never got back to me, nobody has recognized me ever really until now. So a few weeks ago my husband's cousin [29M] has found the videos somehow (I imagine he watches porn 23 hours a day). He emailed the link to the videos to my husband, which he shows me and we decided to play dumb and say it's not me (it was over 10 years ago that the video was shot and the video quality wasn't that high on the link). So he calls him and tells him that he doesn't like the joke. The cousin apologises and says that he thought it would be funny. We thought it's over. This morning, he emailed everyone in the extended family with links to high quality videos (I imagine he has tracked down the source of the videos and bought high quality copies). This was the video that he sent to my husband and other videos as well. He then says in the email that ""It's who you think it is"". Also says that they would have loved to know the truth before allowing ""this girl"" part of the family and around our children. So as soon as this happens, we had phones ringing asking what's going on. Multiple emails saying they don't want their children/teenagers around me any longer. Multiple people deleted me as their Facebook friends and some have taken the liberty of posting some really hurtful status updates like ""the girl we accepted as part of our family was in fact someone who swallowed someone's sperms in front of camera"". If someone sends this to where I work I could even be fired. Honestly we haven't done or said anything. We don't know what to do.

However, studying law and studying abroad has always been a dream of mine and I've worked really hard to get this so it's an opportunity I can't pass up. It doesn't change the fact that I have to end this amazing relationship with a guy I love. I hate the thought of him being with another girl but I know it'll happen and I'm terrified of losing contact with him and becoming strangers. I wonder how long it'll take for me and for him to move on. Do you think if we were to meet again at the right place and right time in our lives we could be together again?

Long story short, my sorority sister ""Jana"" has a really nice Nikon camera. I asked to borrow it so I could take photograph a friend of mine for a competition. As the title says, I tripped while we were taking pictures and I broke it. The whole thing is busted and I don't think it's fixable. Obviously I felt bad, so I looked up online how much these cameras cost. I was expecting to pay like $200 to replace it, but this is a $700 camera!!! I don't have that kind of money. I told Jana today that her camera was broken and she was PISSED. She told me I would have to buy her a new one. I told her I couldn't afford it, and that I shouldn't have to completely replace it since the damage wasn't intentional. It was an accident, and accidents happen. Now she won't talk to me, and apparently she's considering taking me to small claims over this?? My question is, am I wrong to not think I should have to pay $700 so she can have a new camera? How should I handle this?

I've moved to a city, I'll be here temporarily. Through OKCupid, I've made a friend here who's about five years younger than I am. She and I are good friends, and other than a drunken kiss (For context, we were drunk, but I'm not comfortable with pursuing things with drunken women, so I paid for a cab to get her home safe). Shortly after, she made it quite clear that we're better as friends, and in balance, that was a better thing to do. I am, however, having an issue with some of the ways she crosses lines – If she's not attracted to me, I'm pretty uncomfortable with the fact that she puts her head in my lap when she comes by to watch movies. I have spoken to her about it, and she sees that it's a space-and-signals thing. She also has no problem telling me about guys that she's slept with, albeit in oblique ways I'm less and less attracted to her because of some maturity issues she has, but she's a nice person to be around. At this point, I would really like to know a few things, and would appreciate opinions: 1) Why tell me who you're sleeping with? 2) There's a clear maturity gap. I don't make friends very easily, and it's a pattern of behaviour which I've been trying to break, as it's important to have a diverse group of friends around. That being said, would it be a good idea to continue the friendship?

My friend and I were at a party not too long ago and after the gathering we went back to her place. We were both aware of our attractions towards each other for a while but some relationship situations with us both kept us away from each other in ""that way "". But anyways, at her place we made out a lot and got into bed and got all touching and what not but it never got past that. At one point she looked at me and told me she really cares about me. We basically spent the night talking about random things and kissing here and there but nothing further. I was perfectly fine with that and I still am. The only thing is that after that night we talk a little less and when we do it's nothing that'll keep a conversation going and it usually ends pretty quick. We have not talked about that night or what we can make of it now. I want to tell her that I want to try things out between us but don't know how to tell her.

I was out drinking with some old college friends last week and got talking to a friend of a friend who turned out to be going through much the same situation, and ended up going back to her place. I'm not proud of it, the only positive of the situation is that we didn't kiss/have sex, we just chatted and then crashed out fully clothed in her bed.

Just to start off, I am a nerd. I spend my time painting models of dragons, designing/playing board games and I love reading on fantasy myths and stories. However, recently I've been noticing a few comments in which makes me believe that my father doesn't respect me or just sees me as a nerd. Last night my family was having dinner and people were asking me what I would like for my birthday. (it's coming up in July) and while I was telling people I over heard my dad say to my BIL ""my friends introduced me to drinking and drugs, not dragons."" Later when talking about my car, he made a comment, again to my BIL, how I'd never actually worked on a car so how would I know what it was like to get actually dirty. He makes comments like this often, have it be my choice in drinks, my hobbies or really anything. Now, I have always been a mother's boy but I respect my father a lot. He provided well for myself and three siblings. While not the most approachable man, he was there for games, try outs or science fairs. He worked at a job and I grew up in an upper middle class household. I never needed to get a part time job until I graduated, nor did I have to rebuild an engine to get my car running. I don't know if he's just making a joke but I just feel that I've disappointed my father because of my choice in hobbies. Do I just ignore it or do I talk to him?

I have been in a relationship for 2 years and am now engaged to my lovely fiancee. I love him so much and am extremely happy to be marrying him. I met him in Spain (he's Spanish) while I was working there but, about a year into the relationship, he had to move to a different city and we saw each other only on weekends. Now, after 4 months of being completely separated (he was still in Spain waiting for his visa and I had come back to the US to start working), he is finally here! Yay! Except...I am having a hard time with him always being around. I feel terrible because I love him and yet I feel like I need space. The time we spend together is great and I have fun with him, but then sometimes I am just tired and want to relax or be on my own. I realize this is probably a common thing with moving in with someone, regardless of the previous situation, but I also think that, because he's brand new to this country, I am (so far) the only person he really knows. Anyone been through something similar? How do you balance a little bit of independence with someone who only has you to depend on? I keep crying when I'm alone because I feel so guilty for being happy to have alone time and then I don't even enjoy my alone time! He also doesn't have his work permission yet so he just kind of waits for me at home all day and then when I get home from work tired and wanting to relax, he is all ""let's go out! let's do things!"" and it's a little difficult for me.

We get along very well, so I would really like to fix what's happening right now. Basically, she is a very cautious person. I am her first boyfriend, first kiss, first everything. So far, we have kissed and made out, with a bit of fondling by me (none by her). Before making any advances whatsoever, I go very very far out of my way to make sure she is okay with what's happening. She has told me that she appreciates this so much. However, the other day, I brought up going farther, as we haven't moved past the making out in probably 4 months, and I consider myself HL. I am absolutely against pushing her to do something she wouldn't want to do. Her response was basically to say that she liked the pace things were moving at (not much of a pace anymore). However, the fact that we only get slightly intimate every 2 weeks or so makes this relationship feel like a friendship, like I'm dating my mother or something. It doesn't feel at all like she is sexually attracted to me and I am definitely running low on patience. Does anyone have advice for me? Anyone been in her position and have insight? We are talking this out, but to me it is an embarrassing issue and I would rather not talk about it with my friends.

Quick Background: My boyfriend and I have been together for a satisfying and memorable six years. We've lived together for the past three of those six years. It used to be a rare occurrence that there was an argument we had that we couldn't resolve by calmly talking it out. This has changed lately. My boyfriend has odd habit of forgetting important things he says/does. It's been something I've known about him since we met (from forgetting previous actions to forgetting things I witness him telling others), but it really throws a wrench in solving the issues we've been having. Here's an example: He recently invited me to an event related to his job that involves both of our interests. I agreed to go with him. However, a few days before the event I asked him what time we would be leaving that day so I could plan ahead. He completely didn't remember inviting me and told me it was too late since space was limited for transportation to the event. I was kind of hurt, but he kept insisting that for various ""logical"" reasons that didn't even make sense that he would have invited me in the first place. This was the second time in the past few months that he forgot about inviting me to go somewhere with him, but it's hard to talk to him about it if he insists on not remembering these things. This happens all the time in various forms and fashions, but again he insists on the fact that if he doesn't remember it, then it didn't happen. He won't remember leaving something out of place when I know I always put that object where it belongs, he will deny that he told his sister he would do something for her even if I was there in the room and could recite the conversation, and sometimes it concerns important things like previous resolutions to previous arguments/disagreements UNLESS another party is there to confirm he did indeed do/say that thing, then and only then will he admit to things he says he doesn't remember doing/saying.

I gave her everything she wanted but the reasons she gave for breaking up were: * I wasn't social enough according to her: Yes i was silent around her friends because they were strange people and i didn't get a good feeling with them. With my friends and random group of strangers that happen to be at house parties i get along just fine and talk to everyone *I gave up on things: I don't know where she got this from, i usually don't give up on things but it seems she made up for herself that i did. *future: she thought we wanted different things for the future, even though we had discussed it quite a lot and we seemed to want the same things. and still, she has 5 years of college ahead...way too early to start thinking about things like that, our view would prolly change anyway right now we still talk everyday...i really need it because i don't have anyone else to talk to.

I think due to my past experiences with tinder and hookups, I'm very much used to it being a one time thing so after texting the guy I had a date with, I basically gave him the oppurtunity to just sorta get out of it and just said I'd like to see him again but if he didn't feel the same way that's cool. (I was drunk and regretted sending those texts but cest la vie) He replied saying he thought I was beautiful and that he had a really good time and would like to see me again so we've made plans for monday. He also said that he'd never had a date like that before and he was trying to process it. Now, I'm really excited because we just got on so well. but, I guess I don't know how to 'date'. What sort of things do you do? How long do you 'date' for? What are the rules with texting? We text a couple of times through the day with just generally chit chat etc. Ahhh I feel so confused!

Title says it all. I don't know how long he has been doing this but when i'm upstairs playing guitar or PC i sometimes hear something out of the corner of my ear and when i go to investigate i can hear that there is porn being played downstairs. I know it is my dad because he is the only other one home at the moment and he does this when my sister and my mother go away for something like a holiday. This is really starting to annoy me because i'll be upstairs and i might decide i want to grab something to eat or have lunch, use the phone and so on. And then half way down the stairs i hear it and instantly go back up. So, how do i deal with this situation? I guess it really isn't my business if my father watches porn but he puts it up so loud i can hear it from upstairs.

Quick background on me I am 19 in college and I am single as of now few months back me and my ex broke up. When we did I had said I would date someone either two years younger or two years older then me. Not thinking that the two years younger would matter to me. I ended up meeting a girl who is just that two years younger then me. I now fin myself questioning whether or not it is a good idea. She has one more year of highschool to go through and my last relationship had to much highschool bs. I would really like to date her but I find myself stopping because: She is still a minor, she has that one more year of highschool. Stupid as that may be it bugs me i mean if I was 20 and she was 18 and out of highschool I would have no problem with it!

I don't know if this is the right place for this question.. but I'm finding myself in a very confusing situation with a girl that I've known for about 6 years. To provide some background information, when I first met this girl she had a boyfriend in a long distance relationship, we hung out regularly and became very good friends. After awhile though.. our friendship began to turn into something much more intimate. We settled on describing it as ""friends with benefits"".. but even then we weren't sure. Essentially, we were a couple without being a couple. Even a friends with benefits scenario wasn't quite accurate. We went on regular dates.. we went out to dinner, movies, went on trips .. spent every waking moment together practically.. all under the tacit understanding that we weren't a couple and that we weren't in a relationship together. This carried on for about 1 1/2 years .. and yes .. she maintained her long distance relationship while this went on.. I'm a horrible person, I know. Eventually, her boyfriend found out, they split. She moved across the country shortly after and we lost contact. Fast forward to two years ago. She resurfaces and occasionally visits the state I live in.. whenever she does, we always fall back into our old ways. On some occasions we're just friends, on other occasions we're more than just friends... and on other occasions still, we're once again a couple without being a couple. Fast forward to two weeks ago.. we hook up again.. we go out for a romantic dinner, caught a movie, stargazing etc. etc. the next day, she casually mentions that she has a boyfriend and that she feels bad .. not because she has a boyfriend, but because she doesn't feel bad about having a boyfriend. No matter what we do, we always find that we come back to each other without ever knowing what we're actually doing. I'm oblivious when it comes to normal relationships and even platonic friendships, and yet I continue to find myself in this twisted mess of nonsense... I don't really know what I'm asking here, but has anybody been in a similar situation that can offer insight?

We both are foreign students studying in a different country. I liked her from the moment I saw her and finally after 2 weeks I asked her out and she agreed. The relationship is going well and we just click. We have fun together and even give space to each other. The physical aspect got a little faster and we even got intimate a few times. I'm her 1st boyfriend and she is my 2nd. We both love each other, which brings us to our problem. Our culture doesn't prefer Love marriages and inter religious are a big No. Though families need to be convinced and a lot more people after that, the chances are very slim that this will happen. Recently she has become gloomy and even cried that she will have to eventually leave me after our course is done after 5 years. She will probably be married soon after the course and I have a few years more after that. My stand is that we should live everyday with each other and let see how things develop, because 5 years is a long time. She doesn't seem to understand this. I cant break up because it will create years of awkward interaction and is a very stupid reason. What should I do?

Basically he liked her very much but she turned him down after he expressed his feelings towards her. She was just going through a breakup and said she wants them to be friends only. Initially, he was there to support her and calm her down during her breakup but he had a crush on her after a while. Despite turning him down, he kept hanging out with her for two months hoping that she changes her decision but it didn't work. Today he called her saying that they should not spend time with each other again and move on with their lives. She was understanding. However, he is confused whether they can still be friends or not or whether it is possible that they could get together again in the future. Would love to hear your opinions and experiences so that I calm him down. I am his friend [M 23] and want to help him get over his issue.

We've been together 8 years and married nearly 6 months. Recently she's claimed that she's been gaining weight. Not much weight, maybe 10 lbs. She's very attractive, and I haven't really noticed, but it's driving her crazy. In turn, it's driving me crazy. We fight weekly, over the same stuff. She gets upset about her weight and then takes it out on me. This morning, I called her beautiful and she called me a liar. I'm currently sleeping on the couch... again. I love her to death, but I don't know where this came from. I hate to sound cliche, but she was normal before we got married. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to throw in the towel so early, but it's really starting to wear on our relationship. We don't have sex, because she's always ripping herself apart, and it's not exactly attractive to hear that all the time. I find myself voluntarily spending more and more time away. I've tried talking with her about it, and it doesn't do any good. We will be good for a few days and then it's back to the same old argument.

Basically we had a fight earlier in the day, she didn't find it to be a big deal at all, I found it to be a huge deal. (It was about her single guy friend touching her inappropriately.) Then she just ended it because she thought nothing of it. Then later on the day (I'm still pissed at her at this point) she says her dog has an infected eye. (Our dogs fought pretty bad yesterday.) I just said, ""That sucks."" and she started crying her eyes out. She says she doesn't like the fact that our 'minor' disagreement effected something so serious. I want to feel sorry, but I'm just not. It would be a fake apology. I hate that I made her cry, but I'm far from sorry. Am I a bad person?

Hey guys, So a few months back I met this incredible woman from the U.K who was staying with her family in my city for a few months. To cut a long story short, we got along like a house on fire. She is everything that i would look for in a woman. Creative, funny, loving, the whole shabang. We spent a lot of time together over the past few months. Then the unfortunate/ inevitable happened and she left about a month ago back to the UK. It wasn't a sad goodbye as i knew i would see her again. At this point i should mention i have been planning on moving to the UK this year due to upcoming redundancy, time to see some of the world. But i didn't tell her this until the end of our time together. Since she left we keep in contact daily although conversation is disjointed due to timezones, and we manage to Skype once a week. I can't help but start to feel a little empty inside, as it's obviously just not the same seeing her through a screen. I'm not sure where i stand in this situation, she is back with her friends etc probably living it up and good on her. But does she miss me? Does she still think the same way about me? I know the answer is to talk to her about this but i have no idea how to approach the situation. I don't want to come across as thirsty, i mean i am moving to the same country as her later this year. Maybe this would be misconstrued as some insane act of love? Which it isnt. But i am curious as to how she would feel about trying for something relationship wise, seen as i will be in the same country. And from this question whether to start an LDR until i get to the UK? Or should i just keep on keeping on until i get to the UK and if she is available then great and if not ... such is life.

So I pushed for him to ask the person - he really seemed like he didn't want to ask, and kept saying he doesn't care. Eventually he messaged them back, and we found out it was a mutual coworkers wife.. saying she saw him online and thought she'd message him. He completely got super defensive, said he didn't have a clue why she was messaging him, and that she probably only had his number because our mutual friend never had credit on his phone, so he would call or text off his missus' phone. They have 4 kids together, and my boyfriend is a lot younger than her, but something just doesn't feel right about the situation. He also mentioned yesterday he'd nip and say hi to her and the kids when he was working in the shop near their house. Any advice? Am i looking into this too much?

I'll try and keep this brief. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 15 months now. We're currently freshmen at the same college (only twenty minutes from our houses). We met in high school and began dating our senior year. I told her that I love her just two months into the relationship, and she reciprocated. After that, she started talking a ton about our future. She constantly talks about our future career and lives (50+ years) together, always brings up is having a family, and she gets upset whenever I don't show as much enthusiasm as her on the subject. Today, she found out that I've been smoking weed and drinking with my roommate (she knows that I've done that in the past). I fucked up by not telling her sooner, as she found out about it from a mutual friend. Long story short, we had a huge fight. She told me that she hated me, took back her gifts to me from my room, returned an expensive necklace I bought her, and then told me that we're done. But, when I began to break up with her (after she yelled at me to break up with her) she immediately started crying and begging me to work it out with her. When I continued the breakup (since I actually do want to break up with her), she went ballistic and told me that she could never go on without me and that, if I broke up with her, she would go back to her dork and kill herself with painkillers. I freaked out and told her we could stay together. She had to go, so I walked her out and on the way she said that she's willing to compromise on the situation. I feel trapped in the relationship now. I know that I haven't handled things well, but I really could use some help Reddit.

Background first since I think it may help: We had had a major falling out that was mostly on my part. I was being a huge bitch and even tried dating someone else for a short while and said some mean things. He and I broke p and I got back together with my boyfriend, but because of that I wasn't ready to be sexual or say I love you for a while. We're long distance as well. Now currently, we were watching something together last night and doing that joking ""I love you, no I love you more"" thing. I ended up saying I love you most and he said liar, meaning it as a joke. We've done this before, but he's never said liar. It was always ""Nuh uh/No way"" and I could tell. But using that word took me back because of our past. I tried talking to him about it, but it ended with both of us getting more frustrated and I realized it was silly to get upset about and I wasn't going to hold it against him, but at the same time he couldn't seem to understand that it hurt me and I just wanted him to acknowledge that instead of belittling my feelings in the situation ( almost exactly what I told him). Now he's mad at me for getting upset, and said he doesn't want to entertain me at all. He asked I not talk to him today, so I'll try to respect those wishes. But I'm over here really hurt by how this has all gone down.

I didn't kiss her for the first month or so while we were just going on dates, but then I started to (slowly) when she became my girlfriend. It escalated fairly quickly, and fast forward to now I can't keep my hands off of her (holding her hand, scratching her back/arms/legs, etc.) she enjoys this though and I thought all was well until she told me yesterday that she misses before when we wouldn't kiss as much and used to just talk in my car after work (where we met) for hours at a time instead of making out in between conversation. We would talk in my car almost every day for at least 2 hours at a time, and now I feel like I ran out of things to say, but I still want to be with her and I love kissing her. Should I take a step back from where we are and try to just talk instead of being so physical? Is it wrong of her to tell me how often I should kiss her? Any help is appreciated!

My boyfriend and I have been dating for two or so years. We are both 22. Everything in the relationship's great, except his avoidance of the ex-girlfriend topic. Now don't get me wrong, I feel as though most people are that way about their exes, which is fine. The problem here is he never told me about his long-term girlfriend (whom he lost his virginity to, said ""I love you to"" first, etc.) before me, until pretty far into our relationship. I was upset about this because of the fact that we had had tons of unprotected sex before he told me. In fact, whenever the topic of his ex-girlfriend comes up, he is very evasive about it. He told me specifically that he never was actually in love with her and that I was his first love. From what I've heard, their relationship did not end well. It sounds like he kind of feels a bit bad about it in a way; like he feels sorry for her. I think every time he's talked about their relationship it's about how badly he still feels about it. I recently ""stumbled"" across some of his facebook messages (I know, I know. It's bad) which included a conversation with her; nothing major, just them planning to meet up. He has never mentioned them meeting up before, when he told me that he would just briefly let me know if he was going to hang out with another girl (not by my request, but his own). Also, not sure if this is important or not, but from what it sounds like (mostly me inferring, as he is very evasive about it) they had a fantastic sex life that we just don't have together and he feels badly about that as well. This issue has started to make me somewhat insecure about things. Not sure if it's a legit concern or if I'm just being silly. So the question here is, guys, what is he thinking here and why the avoidance? Is this just normal guy behavior that I shouldn't be concerned about? Or should I actually confront him about it? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I joined also minecraft and started playing stuff like LA Noire so I could have more to talk about with his brothers and such. However, when we're not together, I feel like he doesn't appreciate me. He rarely texts me, and struggles to make plans with me, like he doesn't really care. It makes me feel rejected and like he losing interest And I feel terrible when I text him more than once because I don't want to be regulation overly attached girlfriend, but sometimes I worry, because he's cheated in past relationships.

I ended my friendship/relationship with T today. We've known each other for 2 years, kept bouncing between seeing each other and just friends.

The reasons were always genuine and sound, but there's only so much I can take. Every time felt like a rejection. That's what happened today. Supposed to meet up, all fine and dandy last night, then this morning he doesn't think it's a good idea. And I've finally lost my patience with this, have said we need to have some space from each other, that it's clear he doesn't feel the same way about me, and I feel shit and rejected everytime. I know this is the right thing to do. I know I shouldn't be hung up on someone who makes me feel like that. But he is my friend too, I hate not talking to him every day.

Am I wrong for thinking that there is something between us? I am calling this a semi-hookup because it only went to 3rd base. We have been friends for a couple months. We have been hanging out for a while and Saturday night we got rather drunk at a friend's house. Neither of us could drive so we slept on an air mattress. Shortly after laying down the fooling around commenced. It went on for about half an hour then we both kind of had an ""oh shit"" moment when we realized what we were doing. We sat down outside to sober up and had one of the most personal and meaningful conversations I have had with another person in years.(She also expressed her enjoyment with the conversation) We go back inside and I lay back down on the air mattress and she got back into bed with me. Nothing else happened but we cuddled up and talked for another couple hours. Next day, she says that we are equally at fault for the incident but she doesn't want to tell her bf because she is afraid to hurt his feelings. I am beyond confused with the entire situation.

For the last few weeks now, she has been interning abroad and complaining about it being unhelpful to her, that she would rather be home, that she misses me, etc. And yet, she doesn't come home. She wants to put this on her resume and party. I'm assuming she is enjoying her freedom and I want her to have fun and be happy but lately I am having a lot of trouble dealing with it. She'll Skype with me and message me, saying the crazy things they are doing at parties and how many she is going to. She is telling me that she is incredibly horny because I am not there to have sex with her and that she is drinking and getting drunk. And then at times I won't hear from her for 15-20 hours. I know a lot of this has to do with my own insecurities, I guess I'm just looking for advice or an outside opinion. What should I do? She isn't really the type to cheat, at least while sober, but at the same time she has broken my trust before in our relationship with flirting with other guys severely, trying to break it off with me in the past, etc. I'm not sure how to do this?

We had been best friends for about 10 years, being together for 7 of them. I had always told her I wanted to eventually marry her, and really did believe I would. We had a few bumps along the way, and there were a couple of times when she said she was ready for an engagement, but I told her I wasn't settled. That really was how I felt. This was pretty much the only issue we had ever had disagreements over. Issues connected to this had gotten a little more frequent over the last year since we had been living apart because of me going to college here in the US. But about 2 weeks ago we had a discussion about our future, and she said that she could see that marriage may not work out because of my family (in our culture, getting along with each others families is also very important). We both decided that we needed to work on it, and even if it didn't work out, be friends. But then a few days ago by younger brother got engaged. For some strange reason that I now regret more than anything I ever have, I didn't tell my girlfriend - childishly trying to avoid another such conversation. But this morning she found out (as she obviously had to) through someone else, and told me that she did not want to talk to me. I understood her anger and profusely apologized, but she blocked me off. I called her again later in the day and she said she was breaking up with me and never wanted to see me or hear from me again. She also said that I had become the one person I had tried for 27 years to not become (my abusive father), and that she wished the worst for me. Now I have lost my best friend and the only person who knew me; and she thinks that I am the person I have hated all my life. I know I screwed up, and I understand her reasons for leaving me. But I don't know what to do or who to talk to since I don't really have close friends in this country, and I have always been very emotionally reserved with everyone other than her.

When we thought we were living together we had spoken briefly about the possibility of doing one (our group of friends always has one in the area), but nothing concrete, and that was a month ago. I had my suspicions that he would host one anyway without inviting me, so it wasn't a surprise when I found out through a mutual friend that that is indeed the case. I don't know what to do. Due to some pretty serious insecurities I developed during high school, I generally refuse to invite myself anywhere, even if it I know it was a mistake (I have missed parties because I wasn't added to a Facebook event by mistake). I don't want to impose when I wasn't invited and risk some kind of scene (though he's not the type to cause a scene), but this could also be my last opportunity to see some people in this group before I move. I don't think I can bring myself to just show up without a formal invite, even if that's the right thing to do (legally speaking I still have a room in the apartment until the end of the month, so I could choose to show up and there's nothing anyone could do, but that's not how I roll). I don't want to make a scene or create drama within the group, but the whole thing feels shitty, and it's bringing out some long-held insecurities. I don't know what to do.

So my boyfriend and I were dating for about a year until we decided to go on a break last year in March. We were fighting a lot because I wasn't allowed to sleep over his place and he said that it wasn't normal. A week before we broke up he told me he was planning on seeing this other girl that he knew had liked him for a while. I got very upset and he said he wouldn't go ahead with it. Eventually we decided to break up and wait for the right time we could properly be together with no restrictions. We did promise each other we wouldn't see other people during this time. During this break we were still constantly seeing and sleeping with each other until one day I saw a photo of him on Facebook holding hands with another girl. At this point, I recognised he had moved on and let it go. After a few weeks, we started talking again and decided to get back together. I asked him if he slept with that girl he was seeing and he said no, however, I didn't believe him and constantly asked him about it but he kept denying it. Last week, I came home and found he had left his Facebook open, I knew it was wrong to snoop but I just had a feeling he was lying so I read his messages. I found out he did sleep with this girl, he also took mdma with her and boasted to his friend about how awesome the sex was. Now I don't trust him and am very unsure about who exactly is this person I am dating. What should I do?

I am currently in college and my SO lives in my home town and we have been doing this long distance thing for an entire school year now. I visit as often as I can and we started to have sex a couple months ago. We use protection every time and she is on birth control, her mother put her on it. I got back from college the other day and we went over to her place and we decided to have sex. We were in her room and I looked out and saw her mom standing there. We cleaned ourselves up and we both sat down on her bed. Her mom asked to speak with her privately and I just sat there. They came back in and her mom asked me to leave and I did. It has been a couple days since then and contact with my girlfriend has been very sparse and I am getting a little nervous for her and our relationship. When we do talk she does not sound good and she has asked to talk to me about the future of our relationship and how we need to be on the same page. She also says that she feels she is punishing herself more then her parents are and I can only imagine the amount of guilt and shame she is feeling. I told my SO that I told my parents about that night, so both sides know, and she just seems like she has disappointed everyone and is taking this situation really hard, but I let my SO know that her relationship with my parents has not changed because of our actions. Me on the other hand do not know what her parents think of me,if they hate me or just disappointed in me, and am really nervous because my girlfriend is their only child and they have never had to deal with anything like this before. I am afraid that her parents are going to ban me from the house or force her to break up with me or even pull her out of going to school with me in the fall, so I am here seeking advice on how I can help the situation and have everything go as smoothly as possible.

Hey Reddit, I need a bit of advice with my relationship. I met this amazing guy 7 months ago, I wasn't long out of a 5 year relationship that ended mutually and wasn't messy at all. After a few flings I met my current guy and things went really fast, We did the loveliest things for each other but it seems to have got really boring, we spend A LOT of time together because we live far apart so I stay at his a lot or vice-versa. Sex is always frequent and amazing but everything else seems to have stopped, the romantic gestures, thoughtful things and actually going out and doing things. Should it be slowing like this, are we getting lazy and what are some fun couple-y things we can do with each other inside and outside the house?

The two of us have felt the same way about each other for basically 5 years but neither of us ever talked about it. We each had short relationships with other people come and go during this time. The signs were so obvious, but we each would be thrown off by the occasional mixed signal. We've been friends with benefits for the last couple years as well. She's my best friend. She's everything to me. But a few weeks ago she started dating someone and they hit it off. I couldn't handle the ambiguity any longer, so I told her everything. I told her I want to be with her, and that I've always loved her. She told me that it's too late, and that she wants to see how things go with this new guy. She said everything has been perfect with him and that she doesn't feel like she has to impress him. She's worried about us not working out because of our rocky history. I haven't had a clear thought in a week since this happened. I can barely sleep. I can barely eat. Did I really just lose her to someone she just met? It's not like I waited for her to date for a year before telling her. Just a few weeks. Really?

I met this girl at a party and we started talking and flirting. At the end she gave me her number, we've been texting since Sunday morning. We got pretty close and kept flirting, and she told me she liked me. Well, she asks me what I'm doing for Valentine's day, I say that I unfortunately have to work. She replies with ""aw that sucks. I'm spending the day with my boyfriend and dinner with my parents"" My reaction in my mind is wait, back the fuck up, your boyfriend? She apologizes for not telling me but says that she didn't expect to fall for me. We both already like each other at this point, and she tells me she wished we had kissed at the party. I tell her that I don't want to be thaat guy, I've been cheated on before and it sucks. I also say if we keep talking, on Saturday valentines day I don't want to say okay have a fun day hanging with/fucking your boyfriend I'll be here to flirt when you get home! That's wrong in my eyes. She said she thinks of me when she's with her boyfriend. Just hanging out and doing sexual things I have two conflicting emotions. I already like her a lot and it really sucks knowing that the person you like is with another guy. on the other hand though I don't want to be that guy I don't want to break up the relationship or have her cheat on him with me.

Too make the breakup story incredibly short, she dumped me to ""explore"" her feelings in college (later learned she has been crushing on some other guy). Treated her like a princess. We grew so much together, and she told me if we lived 40 years ago she would have married me when we were 18. Fast forward several long months after our breakup. She has a tendency to seem quite bipolar. One day she calls me and tells me she loves me and misses me like crazy and wants all the familiarity of me, and then two days later she will get very fussy with me and demand I give her more space. I'm very confused to say the least. The thing is, I know in my head what I SHOULD do, but damn I seriously fell head over heals in love with this girl while we were together. On top of that, her family and even extended family tell me how much they miss me, how great I was for her. Her little cousins even told me they wanted to be just like me when they grow up. She constantly tells me that she is confused, and that she still has conflicted feelings for me. I love her with all of my heart, but damn she can really mess with my head. Honestly, I'm just looking for opinions. My heart is telling me to be patient, that she will figure things out, but my mind and some of my friends are telling me to move on.

I'll try to keep this short. I've recently(ish) moved to a new city and after a couple months I believe I've started 'dating' someone new, though the relationship hasn't defined. I've never actually ""dated"" per se, and my previous relationship experience was not even remotely normal. It started fast, intense, and became unhealthy after a while. Timeline of events thus far is as follows. First date was last Wednesday, we met up for drinks, wound up talking a *long* time and hit it off pretty well. The date ended up with us making out on a street corner (classy, I know) for roughly 10-15 minutes. Second date, this past Sunday. Met up in a museum and she immediately came up and kissed me. Wandered around museums for a few hours holding hands and intermittently kissing. Ended up going to a bar after for drinks. Total length of the date was roughly 4 1/2 hours. Third date, Tuesday. We met at a bar for food and drinks, and after being there for a while went down the street to meet her friends for trivia. She didn't tell her friends I was coming, and wasn't shy about showing pda in front of them. I got along with them fine and at the end right before she got into a cab, she planted a big one on me in front of all of them, no shame. Thing is, I have absolutely no experience with dating or what 'normal' is supposed to be like, and the logical and emotional parts of my brain aren't connecting very well on this. I'm also kind of socially awkward and I've been told to just go with the flow, but I don't know what the ""flow"" is or how to go with it. I don't know how often I'm supposed to keep up communication, what I should and shouldn't worry about, and basically I keep wondering ""What do I do to not fuck up this awesome thing that's happening to me?"". Any general advice?

Okay so I'm going to try and explain the entire situation with enough detail, if anything more is needed please ask. So I met this girl about 5-6 weeks ago just after Halloween weekend. We met through mutual friends and we all went to a party together. We IMMEDIATELY hit it off and by the end of the night we were making out and feeling on each other. So over the past 5 weeks or so we have been hanging out a ton and have become pretty close. Now the first two weeks we had fooled around a bit, but she had started to kinda back off. So she is completely open to me and she tells me that she is still fucking her ex boyfriend. Keep in mind that we have not had sex yet. And they had been fucking before we met. Now she claims that the only reason she is still having sex with him is because ""it's easy"" and they are ""best friends"". I won't go into details of their break up, but from what she's told me I really think that they need to stop sleeping together. She's told me that she just wants to be friends FOR NOW. I guess I'm kind of just stuck and I don't want to do. I know I should just let her and her ex boyfriend thing play out, but I am really starting to like her and I think the longer I wait on trying anything then she will start to only see me as a friend if I haven't already. I want to talk to her straight up and we have a couple of times, but I'm just not sure what to say or do. I like her but it seems like she is still attached to her ex so I'm really not sure what to do. Any advice? Also please ask for anymore details

Basically, I'm a freshman in college and have been dating this guy for about five months. I've known him around seven. We would easily consider each other to be best friends as well as in a relationship. We live about six hours away when away from University, and I will probably only see him once or twice over the summer due to outside reasons. He has mentioned a few times on doing some grand act of some sort to show his love, despite that I know how much he loves and cares for me. He hasn't brought it up in a while, but I know him well and it's one of those things that sort of festers in the back of his mind. It wouldn't really matter to me if he did whatever it is that he's planning, but I know he would really like it if I did something grand for him. He is always planning things to for me and surprise me, like random dates, little presents, a cup of coffee from my favorite cafe on a bad day, etc. He even wrote me a song. (He's a musician). I try my best to keep him on his toes and do similar things. For example, in the past I've hunted all over town before having to special order a record he had been dying for. It made his entire week when I found it, and he still hasn't stopped talking about it several months later. Basically, I want to do something big and fun for him as a final goodbye and act of love before summer begins. A friend suggested a scavenger hunt that leads to all our favorite places, but he really dislikes scavenger hunts. Another thought I had was to write him a little letter or draw a picture for each day of summer because I know his home environment is kind of shitty and I'd like to cheer him up when I can't be there. I would love any suggestions or creative ideas that might help me out. I've got a few ideas tossing around my head but I thought hearing some stuff from you all might help get the creativity flowing. Sorry this was so long.

So to get my bus home I have to walk through a shopping area on the edge of the main town. It's a well known area for a lot of homeless/immigrants as there's a few shelters and help centres around there. For the past few days I keep running in to the same guy, who, from his accent, has moved over from a different country. He keeps asking me out for coffee or food and I'm finding it hard to find a way to say ""no, I'm not interested"" as I'm afraid it will make him mad. I ran into him again on the way today, and he asked me for my phone number. I tried to give him a fake one but he rang it straight away so the gig was up. I ended up giving him my real number because I honestly didn't know how to get away from the situation, but obviously now I'm worried he'll ring me. I have thought of messaging him and just saying ""sorry if I gave you the wrong impression but I am not interested"" (though I had already slipped in I had a boyfriend meeting me on the hope that would put him off). Or I don't know if it's best to just ignore him, but then what do I do if I run into him again? I have met people like him before, from the same area and it seems like a cultural thing, not that he's intentionally being creepy. I'm sure he's probably just after friendship (but it's still uncomfortable). Sadly, I'm a teeny tiny woman, so it all comes across as creepy to me. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks guys

We've been together for 8 years, married for 5 - I'm not sure what to do anymore. I really love my wife and dogs, we have the same interests and she's helped me become the person I am today. I feel like I'm the only responsible one, I do all of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and housework. We work similar hours and I've asked her many times over the last few years to help out, she did for a little while but always stops. On the Monday the 8th I came home to a messy house like normal, she works a later shift on Monday and Tuesday, and got fed up, so I told her when she got home that we had to figure out a plan to be partners, because I felt like a maid. She apologized and did a few things Tuesday and Wednesday and we made up on Friday - she said she 100% knows that she's been lacking lately and she'll change. We had a great Valentine's Day. Well the last few days I've come home from work and had to do all of the dishes, cooking, and laundry again. I just don't know what to do anymore. How can I convince her to ACTUALLY help me. I don't want to have children with her if I'm going to be stuck doing all the work. I begged her to see therapist 8 months ago and he helped her feel ""a billion percent better"" with an anti anxiety pill and her mood is way better, but she still doesn't do anything I ask or says ""I'll do it tomorrow."" What can I do? I don't want to leave her, I love her very much and want this to work - I just need some help sometimes.

As the title says, I found the guy my friend is dating on Tinder, and he was active one day ago. They've been dating for more than a month now (maybe 2 months?). Since they're not exclusive, normally I wouldn't tell my friend but I know that she wants to become exclusive with him, and he took her virginity. My friend also really, really likes this guy. I think it would crush her if she knew. Should I tell her? It's also the week before finals and she's very stressed studying for her final exams and papers.

We had been together for 3 year and the next week after valentine's day is our forth year anniversary. We both are still schooling but she is doing her internship, so she doesn't have much time being together with me. On the day she broke up with me she said that she has been trying very hard to fell in love with me again because she lost the feeling of being in love with me. But these time, she has been texting this guy and meeting him. She also said that this relationship has nothing to do with that guy but I don't feel it that way. While we are together, she told me that this guy has like her before and ask me for advise. So I tell her to stop talking to him for a while. After a few weeks, that guy talk to her again and she has been talking to her since. I know what's going on but I trust her that she would know how to draw the line properly, so I didn't say much to her. She tell me that the guy understand her more than I do. I can agree with the part where she say I don't understand her that well. But she only tell me when the relationship is ending and it is too late to make it up for her. I don't want to comment if that guy understand her well. During the time when I am with her, I also have fallen for another girl. What I do is that I force myself to love her again by meeting her more often and doing what a boyfriend should do and eventually I have fallen for her again. I feel that I have done something to prove myself that I am faithful but she didn't do her part as a girlfriend to try and love me again.

We were doing really well as we overcame some difficult obstacles and gone through some rough fights. But everything was going smoothly and we were still in love. Then, just overnight, she said she wanted to break up because she has been talking to a guy behind my back and she started developing feeling for him. If she wanted to join a religion and be closer to God then that's perfectly fine with me. But the fact that she joined for a guy makes me sick and confused. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Am I wrong for thinking that she is nuts or too immature to be in an adult relationship if she can just jump ship like that? I have a feeling that I'm better off without her.

Around 2-3 years ago on Christmas day me and the ex, got in to an argument that ended our 8 year relationship, the argument consisted of pretty much every flaw we had inside and outside of our relationship. I won't go in to too many details about the argument. Since the argument we had talked once when she got ahold of me on AIM, she had moved on completely and I still had many built up feelings for her and in my star struck (Because I didn't think she would EVER contact me) state I admitted all of the built up emotions and feelings to her. The next day after realizing what I had done, sent her an offline message basically breaking contact once again since she had moved on and I obviously had not and was feeling extremely vulnerable to what she was able to make me admit to her. Fast forward 2 years, and 4 failed relationships (Different reasons) later, and I'm feeling like I'm not even close to being over this yet and I have no clue how to proceed and am feeling frustrated and still hurt about the whole situation. She pops in to my mind at least twice a week still (And this has stayed consistence even while I was in relationships which may have led to their failure) and has very often been in my dreams which consist of her coming back in to my life, which I can feel are happy and I wake up happy until I realize the dreams have involved her. Contacting her in any way is completely out of the question, she has a kid, a husband, and as far as I know never thinks about me for a second, plus I'd rather just avoid it, I still feel completely vulnerable even given her circumstances. The relationship with her was my most successful and happy relationship to date, I suppose that may also be the cause of how I feel. I suppose I'm trying to get some advice and/or support with my situation as well as venting and getting it out there to people who don't know me or the person in question.

Things are getting shaky. We argue more and more every day. Weve lived together for about a year. Not looking to break up but I want to be prepared with regard to our lease. We entered into lease for a place together. I'm the bread winner. I pay the lease every time. We have 9 months left. She gives me about 25% of the lease (what she can afford to help out with). If we break up can I kick her out? Is she financially responsible for a portion of the lease? Contract has no lease break fee, only a condition that new tenants need to be found or we have to pay or were on the hook until the end. I'm not hurting for cash but I don't want to lose the place. Just looking for advice around that and also the best way to proceed.

My guy friend likes to tease about my weight. I'm okay with that in fact I like to make a fool out of myself when we're together & playfully banter each other. Recently, he's been touchy feely as well. He pokes the sides of my stomach a lot, touches my neck (not in a sensual way), distracts me when im on my phone by tapping it, pokes my cheeks when I'm not looking, being sarcastic, says I'm weird, tells me I should stop because my jokes are corny, mimics my voice, teases me even when I'm with my friends, touches my sore muscles with pressure from workout. There's even this one time when we were sitting, he was messing around trying to get my phone suddenly touched my armpits and smelled it which kinda creeped me out a little bit lol. As a revenge, I tend to pinch, push, punch or kick him. But yesterday, I almost cried because of humiliation. He said something about me shaving something, didn't specifically say my stache (I have pcos) but it was obvious. I was crying all night, is it my fault that've pcos? He said I was old enough not to be affected but words hurt. He said I look like a guy, that I'm macho, asked me how many chics I have so I can give him one. He insulted me right there where there's people (we were riding a bus going home) When he realized I was teary eyed, he felt guilty he was trying to make me laugh. He said I wasn't fun like I used to be, now I'm boring. That if he won't be playful, it would be boring. There's this one time he was joking about my weight saying I should workout, then points to a skinny girl then proceeds saying to be more like a ""chic"".

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 months. We met over the summer before university started, and I fell head over heels. We started texting, but I did't think she was interested, and she didn't think I was either. We started talking again after uni started, and we fell in love. I lost my virginity to her. Later in the fall semester she told me about her sexual past, which was mainly over the summer when we met. She told me how ashamed of it she was because she let multiple guys use her to get attention because she was going through depression, and she never enjoyed it. She tells me I'm the best she's ever had, and she never knew sex could be as loving as what we have. For the record, I was raised conservative(gigantic liberal now), so I still have some conceptions about promiscuous women from how I was raised, but she challenges everything I ever thought about women like that. However, I still get very insecure over her past. I envision the other guys still having sex with her. I know it's not rational, and I have realized that I would be this way with any other girl I date unless she's a virgin, which I don't particularly care for. It makes me worry about the future of the relationship, so I decided I wanted to get counseling.

I am funny, social, caring, loving, a talented musician, good looking, have had some minor successes that I am proud of that are progressing my career further, have very close friends and family who think highly of me, hardworking, and am always looking to improve on myself. I have a lot of things going for me, you may agree or disagree that this isn't low self-esteem, but I am very happy with my life and where I am. Just when it comes to relationships I assume the worst. I mainly jumped to the conclusion of having low self-esteem because I have read online that I am just insecure about myself. Which I totally believe, I guess I would just like to know how to utilize my benefits and what I have going for me. Whenever there is a picture of her posted on facebook, I get a tiny bit of anxiety (which goes away within 10 minutes luckily). Depending on her responses I will text her more or less, and try and work that out. I constantly worry about the balance of me talking to her too much or me not talking enough. We are waiting a few months before actually getting together further because of some complications in both of our lives (not important to my issues). We talk 2-3 times a week so I am hoping we can get together. But basically, I get anxious over things that I don't understand why I get anxious over. I think it's just me assuming that it isn't going to work way too early in the game. It has always been this way for me. Would love some advice on boosting my self-esteem. I've decided to try not focusing too much on the girl and do things that boost my self-esteem like finishing music, working and completing projects. I would really like to get rid of it as best I can. I am willing to do anything from writing out the same thing every day for a year to better diet and exercise.

Yes, this is a When Harry Met Sally-type relationship. *Before anyone says I shouldn't try to copy those over-the-top YouTube proposals: I won't, but I'd still like to do something special.

Besides, it might be more fun to propose on New Year's Eve. So my new plan is to propose while we're in the city. I already asked the hotel if they could help me out and I'm waiting for them to get back to me. Ideally, I would like to do it at midnight but she might want to attend a NYE party and I don't want to do it in public. I might be able to convince her to watch the fireworks from our hotel room and do it there but that would depend on the hotel upgrading us or giving us a nice room. There are a lot of romantic spots in the city we're going to be in but that would mean I'd have to do it on the Jan 1st or 2nd, which is *okay*, though I would prefer to do it on Dec 31. Does anyone have any advice on how to go about it? Do my plans sound too cheesy/rom-comish? By the way, the city we're going to is the place where we had our first vacation together 5+ years ago.

Alright, this might sound childish, but it's kind of a big deal to me. Every year, my in-laws go on holiday to Spain. They're a family of 4, parents, daughter (18) and my boyfriend. We've been together for over 2 year. This year, I couldn't join them, and honestly I didn't really care for it. My in-laws are very shallow people, whereas I'm more of a tomboy/nerd, and we just don't have anything in common. We're still very friendly to each other, I try to understand their fascination with clothes and parties, and they try to not criticize me about spending time on the computer or in the gym. We manage. Anyway, they left on holiday 2 weeks ago, and my boyfriend joined them a couple of days ago. Before he left, we found out that his sister (18) had invited his ex-girlfriend to go along. They never told us anything about this, so even my boyfriend was oblivious to this. We were both very hurt to hear this. Of course, if she wants to invite a friend, I can't stop her, but in this case I think it would've been appropriate to at least inform my bf of this. She left the day he arrived, but they lied about this too (they said she left 3 days prior to his arrival). In the meantime, I'm left to care for his sister's cat everyday. I told my bf I was not comfortable with this because I was *so angry* at her, but it was very difficult to find someone else who was available on such short notice, so I sucked it up (more for my boyfriend than for his sister). Anyway, what I'm asking of you is... How do I settle this? How do I react when they get back? I have to admit I'm a very stubborn person, and I often get angry just for the sake of being angry, which is AWFUL of me, I know. So... How would you handle this?

We see each other every day as we share classes together. Most days she'll come over to my place after class. I'm unable to come over to hers since she lives with her parents. Weekends we spend the nights together after work. So we see each other. A lot. Eventually we'd get bored of each other. But there are days where we can't see each other. And when we see each other the day after, we're affectionate all over again. I know absence makes the heart grow fonder. But it worries me that we lose interest after some time. Does it mean we're incompatible deep down? Surely in the future if we move in together, where we'd be around each other more than we are now, we would be able to stand each other for more than a couple consecutive days.

[So, I posted here a while back] saying I wouldn't update more than I already have but I found out a lot of information after my last post. This will be my actual last post. I managed to talk to her parents about it, and turns out, she really does have cancer. The actual term for the cancer she has is ""Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ."" Now, since I know that not everyone on reddit has a degree in med school and knows what it is, and the fact that i apparently cant link to mayo clinic, it is basically a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This is from mayo clinic. ""The term ""chronic"" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that it typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia. The term ""lymphocytic"" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the cells affected by the disease — a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help your body fight infection."" Her parents have decided to do a Stem cell transplant, to try and help treat the cancer. But since I currently live 960+ miles away, there is nothing I know of that I can physically do to help her feel better myself. Do you guys know any ways, in which I can help her through this tough time? I wish I could visit her, but I don't have the money or am I able to even go out of school for long enough to do so.

My sister in law ""Ann"" called me in tears last night and can't cope with my brother ""Tom"" any more. They have two young children and have been married for 16 years. Tom has a masters degree but can't keep a job. He has been diagnosed PTSD but I think there are other serious mental issues going on with him. He has extreme paranoia, has completely white hair, and has zero skills when it comes to money and interpersonal interaction. I flew Tom out here a few months ago to give Ann a break and to see for myself. He only stayed a few nights with me, borrowed a lot of money, and changed his flight to go back earlier than we had agreed. We didn't interact much. I definitely have to walk on egg shells around him. We didn't fight but we didn't communicate either. According to Ann, he is now getting worse. He refuses to admit a problem, his counselor seems to just validate him, and he is a financial black hole. Ann is having to do all the work as mom, dad, and breadwinner. I asked if she was concerned for her safety and she said yes. But she feels trapped. I am willing to fly my brother back out here to give my SIL a break. She said ""At least a month"" I'm not thrilled about inviting chaos into my life. I am a single dad, and have young kids at home full time myself. My brother is very suspicious of me and has made some pretty insane claims that I got him fired from several jobs and that I installed spyware on his computer and track him. I'm concerned my brother is not able to function in society and is a step away from homelessness. I love him. I don't know how to help. My mom had serious mental health issues, and I housed and provided for her for several years until it destroyed my own marriage and I had to put her in a nursing home. I also cared for my dad until he died of Alzheimer's. I feel like I am the ""responsible"" one and my other siblings are looking to me to step in yet again.

Wife (Amy) and I have known each other 2 years, we dated about a year then got married at the beginning of this year, I met her through an acquaintance (James) whose also her ex husband and her best friend when I came to work in their town. They were married from 19 till 26 and though they divorced they have remained good friends ever since, they have a kid together, we'll call her J, she's 13 and a nice girl though she doesn't really acknowledge me much which is fine because the last thing I want to do is replace her dad or seem like I'm trying to take a key father figure role in her life. James is a pretty good cool guy. He dotes on his daughter and even though he and Amy are split up they're still close and this works well in regards to J who never feels like her life is torn in two due to parents fighting etc I would know because I saw it happen to a couple I knew from college. Anyway, I met Amy through James and all through dating they were cool with each other and I was never bothered, but now that we're married and moved in together, it strikes me just how much James is still in Amy's life, not just in regard to J but they're genuinely good friends who message each other a few times a week and have no problems meeting up to hang out etc There's no feelings on their part, James himself is remarried and his wife is good friends with Amy. I kind of feel like a dick because they have a good relationship in despite being divorced and having a teenage daughter but I also feel somewhat jealous and annoyed that they're close and are such good friends. I was fine with it when we were dating but now that we're married should they really still be so close?

About a week ago I posted about a girl I have been seeing and since it helped me blow off stress I figured I would ask for some general advice about relationship anxiety. Basically, the girl I am dating will go through cycles where we get closer, act like a couple and it is going great. Then this crippling anxiety hits her and she pulls back. She has said she does have feelings and thinks she wants to be in a relationship but is not sure she is ready yet. She has also said her biggest fear is of being hurt or rejected. Honestly, the stress of it all is making me consider ending it, since we are in a strange gray area, but I wanted to see if anyone had experience with girls like this. I want to have a talk with her and try to get her to face some facts, that we could work well together and that if she continues to push me away it will end badly regardless. Anyone have any opinions?

ok! so let me start off by saying that I hate nagging ): but I feel like that is all I do anymore to my boyfriend! For example, I recently found out that I am pregnant, therefor he has to clean the litter box out.. which he never does. so I have to remind him to do it often, which irritates him. But my BIGGEST issue right now is that I noticed he hardly brushes his teeth. we have only lived together about a month, but it didn't take long for me to catch on that he doesn't brush his teeth. I had tried hinting to him that oral hygiene is VERY important to me, but that didn't work. I tried telling him to brush his teeth in the morning before he kissed me, but then discovered that he was only using mouth wash when I asked him to brush. I even talked to him about it! I said ""look, im not trying to be mean.. but you have to start brushing your teeth every day. it makes me not want to kiss you, and its just gross to not brush every day!"" he didn't really say anything back, he just nodded his head (I think he might have been embarrassed.) to make things WORSE, he was eating a turkey sandwich a couple weeks ago, I told him that the smell of lunch meat made me feel sick (pregnancy thing) .. after the sandwich I asked him to go brush his teeth bc I could still smell the lunch meat on his breath.. his response was ""well idk how, I just smoked a cigarette, cigarettes eliminate ALL bad breath.. but I will go use mouth wash."" so I believe that he doesn't brush his teeth due to the fact that he thinks smoking cures bad breath.. I just don't know how to get him to start brushing without seeming like his mother or the most annoying girlfriend ever! its to the point where I don't even want to kiss him anymore.. there has to be a way to get it through his head that he HAS to brush.. im afraid if he doesn't start brushing soon that I will freak out on him.. that is just really gross to me!

I am on study abroad and am debating going back next semester to my home institution. My best friends have a very cheap apartment that I would love to live at but my friend is not leaving for Afghanistan until mid February and our classes start mid January. The other kicker is that he wants to keep the lease because the military pays for it and use it for a little storage. (He doesn't have much stuff and I plan to spend most nights with my girlfriend (23F) of nine months anyway. My girlfriend's roomate (21F) decided for one reason or another to find an apartment and live solo but can't terminate her lease which means my girlfriend will have a whole room to herself in a suite style dorm with two other girls who could'nt give less of a fuck about anything so they're not an issue. So being that I just came back from study abroad and it's going to be very hard to find housing and my girlfriend has told me that I could definitely stay with her until my friend leaves anyway, is this a good idea or is it to risky? It's super cheap and I'm not gonna find another house that economical while I'm so far away.

It's a long, painful story. Bear with me. February 2015 I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years. He cheated and I was over him long before the breakup, but finally all my good coworkers talked me into finding better. One coworker in particular. We started harmlessly flirting around last Christmas, which developed into a close friendship and frankly an emotional affair, given that I was with my 5-year boyfriend. Anywho, knowing I could do better, I moved on and was very excited to start up with my coworker. To my favor, 48 hours after I left my boyfriend, my coworkers girlfriend left him. We were both single and ready to pounce on each other. Fast forward one month and we've moved in together. Things are FANFUCKINGTASTIC. He cooks, I clean, we have fun, life is good. A few weeks later, he dumps me. It was convoluted and terrible. Given that we had JUST moved in together, we opted to stay friends and roommates. Work was tough but we survived. Fast forward another few months of on again off again friends with benefits, and he asks me to leave. I've since moved out. It's been maybe a week that I've been gone and it's been horrible. I cry daily, and I'm struggling with lots of the details. We have so much going on between us, the flirting is still happening but we both know for the sake of our emotional health and job security, the sex cannot happen. Were shooting for friendship but it's extremely difficult. The week before I moved out we were drinking and he admitted some hard truths; he had every intention of proposing to his ex, he still loves her but he's confused cause he loves me, too. He pushes me away cause he says I deserve better. The love is still there between us. The chemistry exists. So I'm asking; do I wait for him to mourn his last relationship? Do I wait for his impending promotion so our relationship isn't against work rules? Or am I being a complete masochist who needs to let the whole thing go and find my happiness?

We've been dating for one month and up until last week, she was very warm towards me. However, the day before I left to help my whole family move into a new city (two days drive each way), she became cold towards me. While friendly, she isn't flirty, responsive to my flirtations or has been warm towards me at all. My mom thinks it's because I missed an opportunity to meet her family (she mentioned that she wanted me to meet her family on a public holiday that passed while I was away a few weeks ago), is afraid I might leave, or I said something to hurt her. Of course she could have cold feet as it's a one month old relationship, but that's just me being negative. That said, when I returned home, all of her toiletaries were gone from my bathroom. She had been looking after my cat for me while I was away, and it's a bit of a shock for me.

Me and this girl have been very close friends for the last 7 months or so. A few months ago we told each other how we felt about each other, we kissed, but nothing else happened after that. I tried to be romantic more often, and try to express how I feel about her but nothing more would come out of it. I would ask her out but she says she doesn't want to risk our friendship. About 3 weeks ago she started talking to another guy. He is still in high school and me and my friend are not. She tells me she has know him for 3 years, and they're reconnecting so I think nothing of it. But when she would talk to him, she would act different. She would laugh a lot more, completely ignore me, tell him she misses him, and just hang out with him lot. One night, we were on FaceTime when he called her phone. She muted me, turned the camera around, and put me on pause immediately. I'm completely confused but I try not to worry about it. After about 15 minutes she unmutes me and fixes the camera and takes me off pause. She's off the phone at this point. After about 2 minutes of silence she tells me she thinks she's in love with him. I am absolutely devastated, but I try not to do anything rash. She tells me they liked each other for 3 years. I ask her why she won't go out with him, and she says she doesn't know. I ask if he feels the same and she says yes. I want to ask her how she feels about me but I'm not sure if there is even a point. I really like her, and I hoped she still liked me, but I feel like all the time we spent together, the kiss we shared, the things we did for each other, the romantic gestures I tried, was just a waste. I am absolutely crushed and I don't know what to do.

My girlfriend likes to spend a lot of time together and has few close friends that she hangs out with. She doesn't seem to understand my need for alone time, especially since we started living together about 6 months ago. She says she knows that things like ""distance makes the heart grow fonder"" are usually true in some way and that people need a bit of time away from their partners sometimes. She says that for her, being at work for 8 hours is her alone time. For me, work is work and isn't really the same as having some free time away from her. She complains and says that spending more than 2-3 hours with friends without her is not normal. Sometimes I would spend 5-6 hours with friends maybe once a week. Am I weird or is that ""normal""? She says that once people are in a serious relationship it's normal to spend almost all of their time together. I totally get that it's normal to see your live-in partner every day and be around them a lot, but as much as I love her, I can't see myself continuing to spend 90% of my non-work time with her. Even 60% would be better I think. She's very insecure and doesn't seem to have her own interests. She also has some pretty bad anxiety and diagnosed with ptsd so she kind of fears people too. She likes to watch me when I play a video game for example, and I don't mind usually but when it's every time it's kind of weird. She says that 30 minutes of alone time per day should be enough, but I don't want to feel like my time is rationed. I'm not saying that I don't want to spend time with her at all, I really do enjoy most of our time together, she just doesn't seem to understand my needs. It feels like I'm her entire world and while that kinda sounds sweet I guess, it's really driving me crazy...

Before we first starting dating we were still making out/ I had fingered her in her bed the first weekend of her freshmen year. A few weekends later I had started making out with another girl and she ran off and gave her first blow job to my ""best friend"". We didn't talk for maybe 6 months after as that was clearly not cool with me. We eventually saw each other again in May of last year and rekindled what we had before, but I had no idea from ""best friend"" or her other than them making out, we eventually begun our relationship last July and made it exclusive and she told me about it maybe a month into the relationship when we had the who have you had sex with before me talk. Since we weren't dating I'm okay with the whole scenario, but the part that seems to still irk me is that she did it to get back to me and took it a step beyond for which she has ""no explanation for"". She has done nothing ever again like that, but am I overreacting/jealous that it wasn't me as her first or am I right to be dissatisfied with her because she purposely did it to hurt me and as much as I hate the thought of it you can't teach old dogs new tricks.

Okay, so I'm in an extremely complicated situation. My girlfriend has full legal and physical custody of her children because her ex-husband is a psychotic sociopath. The guy has 5 hours with the kids every other Saturday and the visitation has to be done in her home. Every single time he is over there (if he shows up) he will lie to the kids in front of her to try and make her angry. Saying things like ""Tell mommy bye because she won't be seeing you anymore."" Or ""Mommy is a bad parent isn't she?"" He will then try to take videos of her reaction (usually she doesn't react) or take pictures around her house of messes that happen while he is there to try and use them in court. The guy doesn't pay his child support, smokes around them whenever he gets visitation outside of the house, never changes their diapers if he has them and one time didn't take the oldest to the E.R. when he needed to go. Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation? He's been stalking me lately and I've been taking pictures every time I've seen him to have proof if anything does happen. I'm positive he is planning something and he has threatened to steal the kids and take them out of country. I'm about at my wits end but I love my girlfriend and her awesome children.

So I talk to my wifes brothers fairly frequently as we're pretty close. He seemed a bit odd so I asked how he was. I could tell something was wrong and he said he was fine. We talked and I asked how he and his g/f were. He said things were good. I replied with ""Hmmm. Really?"" ""yes, everything is excellent"". Again I replied with ""For some reason, I don't think you're telling me the truth"". He confessed they split up and laughed ""You must have some sixth sense"". My wife was talking to him too (We were on skype with him). The skype call barely ended when she called her Mom and Dad to sort of weed out if they knew. She didn't let on but immediately called her sister and told her that he seemed down and started mentioning He changed his FB picture and she wasn't able to find her on his Facebook. She checked hers and she was gone off her sisters FB too. Her sister put 2 and 2 together and now knows without my wife DIRECTLY telling her. Her take: She cares for her brother a lot (and she does) and wanted to get them to call him to cheer him up. She swears she didn't directly tell anyone. So she's free and clear. My take: She never should have called her parents or sister and left it to him to tell them when he was ready. Now, they're going to ask about it. I feel it was overstepping her bounds. She disagrees. We actually discussed this and just neither one of us can agree. So, help us, who is in the right here?

Hey everyone, I don't mean to bother any of you with this ""wow my girlfriend is so prude"" stuff, but there's a little more to it than that. So here's some context. We've been dating for about 5-6 months now, and it has all been going great! However, our sexual life has sort of remained really bland after like month 1. The ""farthest we've gone"" is just making out. Now here's the dilemma. I personally think that intimacy is key in a relationship to bond both physically and emotionally and to get closer to your s/o in another way. The problem is that my s/o does not really agree to that, at least I don't think. So here's the dilemma. When we're together and things are getting hot, I've tried to ""make a move"" with my hands by grabbing/feeling, but she always responds to that very uncomfortably and would move my hands away/stop kissing me, and frankly, make it extremely awkward and would just try to change the subject. So then I tried talking to her about it, and what she is comfortable with (My worst nightmare is to make her uncomfortable in any situation.) To this, she just replies ""I don't want to talk about it. You just need to go with the flow. Planning stuff is too artificial."" Now you can kinda see where I'm at. If I try to ""go with the flow"" she'd stop me, but if I try to define boundaries, she changes the subject and doesn't want to talk about it. I obviously don't want a relationship centered around sexual stuff, but at the same time, it's incredibly frustrating the situation I am in. Any advice would be great. Thanks.

Hi Reddit! I'm looking for some insight into my relationship. Using a throwaway because my boyfriend knows my account name. I've been with my boyfriend now for about 8 months, so not terribly long. I want to first point out that I think my boyfriend is pretty great. He makes me laugh, we play, he's supportive if I'm having a bad day, we rarely get into arguments. We have a lot of the same interests and overall, I'd say we get along pretty great relationship and currently I don't really have any issues or complaints. However, I'm wondering at what point I should start being concerned about certain ""milestones"" not being reached? Things like meeting his family, and saying ""I love you"" are things that come to mind. While I do realize that everyone is different and reaches those points in their relationship at different times, there has to be some point in your relationship where, if those things haven't happened, you might start to wonder about the seriousness of your relationship right? Currently, we are only at 8 months in so I don't think it's too bad that those things haven't happened, but as each week/month goes by, I do start to wonder if they are going to happen and I wonder if I should be worried that they haven't happened yet. Is there anyone that had a relationship where it took a long time for big things in your relationship to happen? How did it work out? I really want to have faith and trust that those things will eventually happen, but when I think about my last relationship, it took my ex over a year and a half to say ""I love you"" and he dumped me 3 months later, which led me to believe that he never really loved me and he was just saying because he felt like he should at that point. For the record, also, I have talked with him a few times about meeting his family (he's met mine), and he says he's waiting for a time when it happens naturally (not sure if that's weird or not). So what do you guys think? At what point should I be worried if certain milestones haven't happened?

So as the title says, I've been thinking about her. I'll call her Girl A. We dated years ago while I was finishing high school and during my first year of college. We were together for about 10 months. It was a good relationship, but it isn't what I'd call sophisticated. This was before I had a car of my own. Other obstacles prevented us from having a deeper relationship, our age being the biggest one. I didn't really look at these factors until recently. I met my current girlfriend during my first year of college and we hit it off immediately. I'll call her Girl B. During this time, I started to feel distance between me and Girl A. She was into performance arts and spent most of her time with her theater friends, and that was a problem for me. I broke up with her. A few weeks later, I asked Girl B out. That was almost 3 years ago. Throughout my relationship with Girl B we have had some problems here or there. But we worked through them. About 7 months ago I almost broke up with her because I wasn't feeling as strong. Since then, things have been better than ever. The crazy thing is, the past month or so Girl A has been on my mind. Just typing this hurts because I love Girl B so much. A small part of me wishes I could give Girl A another chance, or at least have the option to, but the bigger part of me loves my current girlfriend. I feel like me and Girl A didn't get to a far enough level in a relationship, like it was cut short. I haven't seen, let alone talked to Girl A in at least a year, so I don't know why these feelings are hitting me now. Any input is appreciated. If you guys have questions I'm happy to answer them. Thanks.

I have been married to my wife for 5 years. In the past, while we were married she was unfaithful with a complete piece of crap human being. From what I can gather she went after a ""bad boy"" type because I am too normal and responsible. After that she promised never to talk with him or have any contact with him. While on work trip I discovered a facebook chat conversation between then saying some pretty messed up things. I confronted her about it and again she is apologetic and says it will never happen again... There was never a consequence the last time for what she did and I don't feel like she will keep her word his time without something to persuade her. What do you think about printing out the conversation she had with him and making her show a couple of her best friends so they know what she did? I have also made it very clear that if there is any contact what so ever between them again that I will ask for a divorce. I want her friends to know that as well. Is this a terrible idea? I'm sorry about the crappy writing, I'm actually a really well versed and educated person, I'm just not thinking completely straight at the moment.

Hi guys/girls, I'm not entirely sure if this is the right section for the post but wasn't sure where else to put it. I am a 26 year old male. I'll start by saying I recently got out of a 7 year relationship about 8-9 months ago, so obviously since I was in a relationship since I was 18-19 I'm not too experienced with the ""dating world"". I'm usually a fairly shy guy and not the best socially but definitely not the worst most social situations. Since my LTR ended I've met a few new girls, one was a FWB arrangement that went on for a few months and mutually ended. Since then I feel like I'm ready for something a little more and maybe even another relationship if the right person comes along. So I've got a few girls numbers over the last few months to arrange to meet up for a date but every single time I get a number I seem to overthink everthing and I psych myself out from contacting them again.... I think things along the lines of I won't really know what to say or how to keep a good conversation going in a 1 on 1 situation with a girl that I hardly know.. So I just don't bother calling/messaging them and by the time I want to it's way too late :-\ That has happened 3 times now.... Any tips/advice to help me overcome this? (Sorry if it doesn't make complete sense, wrote it on my phone from work)

Alright, well for most of my life I've pretty much been one to only hang out with like 3-4 people at a time since I've never really been one to have too many friends. Well, I just started my first year of college this year as a Freshman and have been trying to change that. I basically reached out to a bunch of people that I knew who went to my university through a blogging website. We've met up several times, had dinner, but the relationships/friendships never seemed to go anywhere. We would usually have dinner once or twice and then it would end right there. By end, I mean, they would ""unfollow"" me from the blogging site, Snapchat, and ignore me. I don't think I ever did anything wrong to begin with. Even my close friends agreed that I was polite to these people and they're not sure why they decided not to keep in touch. When I step outside and look from a different perspective, though, I can see how I can maybe come off as ""fake"". Me, personally, am very outspoken about my opinions and I don't usually have too much of a filter. While I'm aware of this, I think whenever I meet new people, I try to repress that side of me and thus, I come off as ""fake"". I'm usually over polite, I make too much small talk, and I ask too many questions in an attempt to not show my ""true"" side since I feel like most people may not like it. So, I can either be my true self (loud, opinionated, funny, no filter) and lose friends that way or I can be my ""nice/fake"" self and continue to lose friends like I'm doing now.. What to do? P.S. Is this normal in college? The making friends part? Does it take a while?

Hey /r/Relationships! This is an obvious throwaway account. I'll try to post as much detail as possible. Some background, when I was little, my parents raised me as a Catholic. But as I grew older, I did not associate myself with any religion. I am **not** against any religions, in fact, I have a very open view on all religions and I appreciate everyone's opinions and faith. Today, my girlfriend asked me to convert into a Muslim. At first I thought it was a joke, because her and her friends would always joke about me becoming a Muslim. But I found out she was being serious and I wasn't sure how to respond but to say ""I can't."" I also want to say that before we started dating, we made an agreement that I will not convert and if that is something that will get in between us, I don't think a relationship would be a good idea. Anyways, she goes on and on about why I should. So I asked her, why all of a sudden she's asking me to convert. She says that before we get any further into our relationship, her parents wants me to convert. Now, I really love this girl, but I don't want to convert for the wrong reason. I keep telling her that if I converted, it'd be for the wrong reason. (I've been told that converting for your wife is not a good idea. Something along those lines.) So what do I do? Is there anything I can do to compromise?

We were happy, no problems. We got along great, made each other laugh, and said ""I love you."" When asked for a reason, he says he's not ready to fall in love again (he was crying) after a hard breakup many years ago. I tried to tell him I wouldn't hurt him--that I'd be patient, but he ""just can't. I'm sorry. I thought I was ready."" He pursued me. But that I'm ""wonderful, perfect, everything I could ask for."" Should I be patient? He's a good person, and I think he's doing this to protect himself. Not even my best friends see any red flags in him except for misgivings about this breakup. I've been hurt many times by complete jerks, and he's not one of them. Also, we bring out the best in each other.

Last September, I met the sister of a boy I trained in a basketball team. I liked her immediately. This June I found her on FB and right after trainings are finished, I added her, so I don't have to seen her and have awkwardness if she didn't accept me. She did accepted me, but she had a bf. I backed off, I respected that. But she started to talk to me, and we ended up talking all day for 10 days and we used to talk on the phone 3h every night. She said she liked me too that September but she thought I was too beautiful for her, just as I thought about me and her. Also she said that they were done b4 we start to talk and when she returns from vacation, she'll break up with him. 3 days before she returned she said that she feels awful for what she is going to do to her bf and she wants to push it through the limits with him. And if they break up, they will. She said that she wants us to continue talking, she really likes me as a person, and she wishes we had a better timing in that. Yesterday I closed temporarily my fb for an unrelated reason, and after 3d of silence and no communication she called me at 2am, probably to ask me why... I didn't answer and I don't know what to say to her tomorrow, bc I must call her... I really really like her, I feel like dead inside from this roller coaster of emotions I had... I want her with me, and Im in a dead end. I don't know what the right thing to do, stop talking to her or continue talking to her and wait til she breaks up? ───────

This all happened around 20 minutes ago. She and I were sharing some particularly romantic memories. She and I separated badly but grew closer after distancing ourselves. We now share a very good and much more appreciative, albeit platonic relationship. She and I often talk about out past relationship and where we are in our lives now. I still feel for her but I recognize that she has moved onto other things and have no desire to endanger her relationship by making advances. What happened was she told me that she'd like to give me a proper kiss and I said I was flattered and I would honestly like to but I don't want her to do anything she will regret. She then went on to ask her boyfriend. I didn't know she would but she told me about 5 minutes later what happened and she told me it was a horrible mistake. I agreed but now her boyfriend is very scared and thought we were engaging romantically behind his back. I have and always will be entirely against infidelity and unfaithfulness but she and I have a fairly loose and progressive view on relationships and etiquette (kissing as a greeting, threesomes, etc). Now her boyfriend is demanding she sever any communication with me. I am ok with this if it means reassuring him and allowing her to regain stability in her relationship. How can she remedy this situation, while being honest and clearing up the emotions of it all?

Alright guys - hoping that I can get some helpful advice here because I'm really struggling. I'm 25, my gf is 24. We met in college, have been together nearly 5 years (not married yet, and I'm very on the fence about whether or not that's where we're headed), and have lived together for the last 2. My situation is a bit odd - she absolutely loves sex. Whenever we have a chance to do it, it's on. Outside of sex (and I mean actual PIV intercourse), she has 0 libido, 0 desire to be intimate in any way. She had to have an operation ""down there"" at one point which meant we couldn't have sex for 2 months, and in that time we basically never did anything sexual - there was one time that I feel guilty about because it took a lot of convincing on my part. She also has had to change birth controls multiple times this year so far, and each time it messes with her hormones and she ends up on her period for 2-3 weeks out of the month. Same store each time - if we can't have sex, nothing is going to happen. I don't like thinking about it this way, but everything leaves me with the impression that she's extremely selfish in the bedroom. I've always been a bit of a giver - I'm generally not just happy, but eager to go down on her and I legitimately enjoy it when she gets off - to the point that sometimes when she's on her period I'll still do things to get her off, and she almost never returns the favor (at most, once every 3-4 months). On the flip side, if she's out of commission for one reason or another though, there's nothing I can do to get her in the mood to fool around at all. I hate the cliched ""I have needs too"" statement, but it's true. I don't know what to do - I really, really love her and love being with her, but the lack of intimacy leaves me feeling more often than not that she's more of a great roommate than a romantic partner.

She said she was falling in love with me and everything was right in the world. 2months later her sisters bf broke up with out of the blue and her parents became ""antiboy"". She told me that we should tone it down because of her parents. I agreed and we rarely saw each other after that. I confronted her about the lack of actual contacted and asked her if we even were going out. She said not really and she said that she might like her lab partner, who she claimed before that he was just a friend, and wants to have more experiences. What the hell does that mean?!

Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble. I just want to make sure anyone who gives an answer has enough context to help if they can: A year ago, a girl I was really into dumped me and strung me along for a while after that. Now she's sent me an email simply saying ""How have you been?"" I feel this is inappropriate for two reasons. First of all, the break was really bad. We both said some pretty hurtful things and I was definitely the one worse off for it. I've spent a lot of time trying to be more emotionally open to relationships since then, and it's always failed miserably. She, on the other hand, has been dating another man since two days after we officially broke things off. Secondly, for the last 14 months she, at least, has been content to pretend as though I don't exist. Any time in passing we've seen each other, for instance, would be as though a complete stranger had walked by me. I can't deny that it hurt a little, because of course it does, and this email just reminds me of all the hurt I felt. I am at a loss of how to handle this. I feel like she's definitely sending this because she's graduating and not because she actually cares about my feelings. She was never shy about having me aroundto comfort her after the breakup/whatever she said she was going through and then tossing me aside once a new guy was in the mix. I was totally used and completely devastated. Should I email her a brief update tomorrow morning? What has anyone else's experience with this been? Is there any way I'm not looking past my old hurt and being stupid by NOT wanting to respond? Is there actually a healthy solution to this that I'm possibly overlooking because of my feelings? I don't want to regret doing nothing, but then again I'm afraid this could just open up old wounds, and I really don't want that. Thanks for reading if you made it this far!

There's this girl that I met a couple years ago in school. I asked her out then, but she had a bf at the time. We ran into each other years later when we shared a class together. We never really chatted outside of class, but i remember her telling me ""dont be a stranger"". After graduating not hearing from her in 2-3 years, she randomly invited me to her birthday a couple months back. She was drunk as shit and I was pretty drunk. Nothing happened, we danced and there was a lot of physical contact. I texted her, she replied, and I texted her back and that was the end of our correspondences. A couple months later she invited me to another party she was hosting. She didnt get nearly as drunk, and I smoked with my friends before, so I wasnt as social. We went out when I drove up to visit her and go to a show and met up with some of her friends. I live about 2 hours driving distance away and I'm not sure what to do.

She's Christian and I'm ""spiritual"". I don't believe in the biblical God nor that Jesus is the way. We're both accepting of each other's beliefs but it's a huge deal when I think about children. We're both loving and compassionate people in a great relationship, but this is a huge concern for me and I've tried to bring it up a few times with the topic getting swept under the rug when it got difficult. Last night we dove into it and it left both of us floundering without answers. **I'd love to hear from successful couples who have navigated this issue.** * We both want our hypothetical children to make their own decisions when they're able and not be indoctrinated with anything, but until that point they'll need to be raised in a certain way. I originally agreed that we could raise them Christian, but as I've attended church with her, I realized I disagreed with a lot of what was taught and how it was taught and I would want to discuss other perspectives as it came up with the kids. I realized what I meant was ""I was okay raising them around Christianity as long as I got my two cents in as well."" This realization resulted in our talk last night. This was obviously a huge change for her and she spent the night crying in my arms feeling like this could be our deal breaker.

Last summer, I found out that my dad was cheating on my mom through accidentally logging in to my dad's email. Unfortunately, my curiosity got the better of me and I skimmed the first page of his inbox. Yes, I know this is really wrong of me but previously my brother [20/M] had mentioned that he believes our dad was cheating so I wanted to clear his name, but that backfired... I saw emails concerning my dad booking flight tickets to Kuala Lumpur and originally thought it was with my mom, but then I looked at the name and realised it was a woman I did not know. Let's call her ""Amanda"". So, naturally, I searched her email up on my dad's account and found countless other exchanges between them, and by then I was convinced. (By exchanges I mean hotel receipts, plane tickets, ""sweetie""s, ""darling""s etc.) Being the creep I am, I went on Facebook and searched her up and found out that she, in fact, has a child as well. I did a little more digging on my dad's email and found out that Amanda had divorced her husband because she wanted to be with my dad, and my dad had contemplated divorcing his wife of 20 years but ultimately decided not to, so they continued their relationship secretly. So, my issue is, what should I do? It kills me a little every time my dad comes home and my mom is ecstatic and tells him about her day, makes him dinner etc. I want to tell her but I also don't want to damage their relationship...

And my fiancée had this talk with his dad the next day, and I don't know exactly what was said but basically his dad strongly implied that my fiancé should be marrying someone more on his level. I'm guessing pre-nups got a mention as well. My fiancé, who was blissfully oblivious to their feelings before, stomped out of the house and is still pissed.

Just to give you some background... We started dating 5 years ago, January 2010. For the first month or two our relationship was good. We would have late night chats and I really did enjoy her company. She is a very good women and does put a lot of effort into my family.However… I just don't think I love her. Or that I ever did. The more I think about it now the more i come to the realisation that i did all this because it was kind of expected from me. I won't go into all the details but we've been fighting every day for the last year. I hate myself for being with her even though she is a good person (most of the times). Recently it's only gotten worse. We had sex for the first time in 8 months on valentine's. last night she threw that back in my face while she was going on again. She would do this 3 times a week where she would go on for at least an hour of how terrible I am. and everything I do wrong. Stuff we've talked about and resolved she brings up again and again. For some reason she just can't let shit go. I didn't think I'd ever be a person to get divorced but currently the only times I feel normal or happy is when I'm not with my wife. It's at this stage of my life where I don't care about the financial or emotional implications. I just want to wake up in the morning and actually want to live my life.

Met a guy (25yrs old) through a dating app. We hooked up a couple times, then he said I was too neurotic to have a serious relationship with and that he didn't want to hook up with me anymore. But I still wanted to hang out with him because I'm new in town and he's a genuinely cool and funny person and we actually had a lot in common. And then we started hanging out a couple times a week, just platonic chill stuff like having a beer and watching TV. I had fun and I was totally okay with being just friends. A couple nights ago while we're hanging out, the dating app on my phone keeps going off - it's some cute guy pinging me. I ping back several times, thinking nothing of it. Suddenly, my friend flips out on me and says I'm being disrespectful and this is the last time he'll hang out with me and that I need to grow up and learn or whatever. He was so angry that I just called him a cab home. When I escorted him to the cab, he seemed genuinely happy to be leaving, then he hugged me goodbye.

This is a followup to this situation: We had been together for nearly 1.5 years, and it has been a very rocky relationship. We're both graduate students with very limited time. We both dealt with depression and supported each other through it. We didn't always used to be rocky. But somewhere down the line we started arguing about the same things. We broke up 3 times over the same cycle of arguments. As he's said before -- when we argue it's when he needs space at the exact same time that I need closeness. I fear that he's not emotionally available, and sometimes I'm afraid that he might not love me. And I suspect that he fears I'll never be content with this relationship, that my expectations are unrealistic, and that I demand too much of him. Neither of us are clearly in the wrong or right. I take full responsibility for the fact that I didn't give him enough space in those times when he really needed it. I take full responsibility for stressing him out over my upsets. I'm not sure that he wants to hold some accountability for the ways he's abandoned me when I asked for emotional support. A month since the breakup, we're still talking, and recently we've talked about trying one last time. He says that he's willing to try something different -- he's willing for us to go to couples counseling to figure out whether or not we can become better communicators to each other. He says he can't promise me that he's not going to walk out again, and he can't promise that he's not going to hurt me to the point that I'll be done for good. But he says he's still with me for a reason. In fact, besides our communication issues, we are compatible in every other way. I love this man deeply. Reddit, I'm asking for your help to figure out what I need to do. I want to make this work, I want us to work towards a healthy relationship, and I want to have a stable, happy life with him. What can we do? What can we work on? How can we move forward?

I'm 22 and I don't have very much experience dating, despite my efforts. I usually connect fairly well with women, but then it falls apart and I can't pursue or date a girl even if I feel like we both like one another. I don't want to sound like an asshole, but I've been told that I'm 'too much of a catch', or that some girls that I've tried to date have been worried that they like me 'too much'. One of my female friends told me that some girls will refuse to date a guy in the short term if they think he has a lot of potential as a partner. She claimed, essentially, that girls are sometimes worried that they don't have their own lives together well enough to keep a guy interested, and so they'll refuse to date just so they don't mess things up and ruin a potential relationship in the future. Do girls really do this, or was she just being nice to me and concealing a deeper flaw in myself that is preventing me from having successful relationships?

Im 29M she is 21M. I want to propose soon, but need to know how to go about bringing this up. I met her through my best friend as he was dating her sister and is now married to her. We met about a year ago, and have been close ever since, always talking, always together, we recently just started officially dating 2 months ago. I've been in love with her for a while now, and she feels the same. I've never felt so great with someone, we both had a bad past of being crushed, yes our age difference is in the spot light, but we are great together, everyone agrees when we are around everyone says we look very happy, we have an honest relationship, we hide nothing and we always express any concerns. We get along great with eachothers families, we argue about things here and there but always end up hugging and kissing it out. We have gotten past a few pretty big speed bumps as well, she has always been there for me as I for her...I was pretty sick for a while and still am, with a chance of never fully getting over a sickness I have, she says she'll always be here and I promised I'd always be here.. all in all.. I'd say we have a perfect relationship along the lines of all the needed elements. Honesty, being faithful, supportive and understanding.

I met a girl about 6 months ago, and we hit it off straight away. Of course, turns out she has a boyfriend. Anyway, we've gone out for drinks twice in this 6 months, and both times, we're absolutely inappropriate together. We haven't gone home together, but if I had a GF who behaved the way this girl behaved with me, I'd break up with her on the spot. She has told me she views her ""friendship"" with me as ""keeping her options open."" She's traveling to South America for three months, and she essentially begged me to come with her. I have two weeks paid vacation to use, and she wants me to spend those weeks traveling with her. Of course, after she asked, I was elated. And of course, I assumed we'd be hooking up during this trip, and perhaps maybe she was finally leaving her BF. So, I met up with her to go over travel details. She was being very weird with her body-language, trying very hard to keep things cold and platonic, which is never how we are when we're alone. I asked, ""Are you open to the idea of our hooking up while we're together those two weeks?"" She said, ""No, absolutely not. If I do hook up with someone on this trip, it will be someone I meet there, not you. You remind me of my life here at home, so I won't hook up with you."" And the rest of the night, she put on this extreme countenance of how she and I are just platonic and have always been platonic and nothing has ever happened between us and that her BF and I would be best pals if we ever met and that we SHOULD meet, too. So, just how crazy and stupid would I be if I actually went with her?

I've been close friends with Allie for ten years, we've always been there for each other and used to spend large amounts of time together. These days are both busy so we see each other less but she calls most days. The problem is Allie has always been needy, now her complaints are the same issues I'm dealing only mine are more severe. Her career isn't moving quickly, her bf of one year hasn't proposed yet. My industry basically died overnight, I'm finishing a cert for low-paying work that will hopefully help me get a career. I've been single for two years because I've been financially unsuccessful and found dating difficult, the collapse of my career ending a 3 year relationship. I try to care but hearing her work drama and bf issues when I'm struggling to stay afloat is tiring. I said I'm focused on me right now and that it is harder to be there for people. I also expressed that I wouldn't mind being there for her as much if we hung out like we used to. I value the friendship but I'm not getting enough out of it anymore. Most of our talks are when she's driving home from work in traffic or driving to her bf's house I feel like I am a distraction more than anything. I'm hoping you all can help me find the words to express that I care for this person and want to be there for them but that it's difficult when I have my own troubles.

I am 45M and have been together with my 38F girlfriend for 11 years. The last 4 years it's been a dead bedroom situation. We've talked about it probably 3,853 times, and ultimately it boils down to the fact that she's just not interested in having sex anymore. She insists that she simply has no libido in general, but I know that in most of these situations it's usually the case that one partner is just no longer attracted to the other, whether the low-libido person realizes it or not. The whole time, she's remained super romantic with me. She loves to kiss, cuddle, go out on dates, walk through the park holding hands, go to plays, take road trips and vacations, watch movies, drink wine in nice restaurants, meet up with other couples, etc. The kicker is that she talks excitedly about plans for our future together. This is all very confusing to me. If she's no longer attracted to me and doesn't want to do naughty grownup things, I can accept that. It's unfortunate, but that happens sometimes in relationships and life goes on. But, when that happens don't people usually pull away romantically as well? How is it possible that she is planting kisses all over someone and excitedly planning a future with a person she can't bring herself to touch?

I've been with my long distance girlfriend for almost 4 months now, and our relationship has been pretty great and we will finally be together in just a few months. Now we had a talk today, and we got into not quite an argument, but a discussion about a problem. We talk on Skype daily, and whenever we do she always seems to be covered up more, ie. today she wore a flannel and usually as a girl you'd button it down, and she specifically buttons it all the way up prior to talking to me. We've talked about it before and she says she wants that to be more of a suprise, but I think it's pretty silly that she walks around showing cleavage but completely covers up for me. I told her I don't think it's fair that literally any guy can look down her shirt at anytime, yet she entirely covers up for me. She says it's because I'm important and that everybody else doesn't matter, but I guess I don't see that, I see it more as if others get to see more than I do and that's kind of shitty. It's not as if I haven't seen her chest before, and yes, I've met her in person, and so I'm not sure why this is such a big deal to her, but it makes me feel kind of insignificant in a way, that a random kid at her school can see more than I, her boyfriend can. I know this is a silly problem, and she's a fantastic girlfriend and we kind of talked this out, but we didn't really get anywhere. There are no hard feelings, bit I guess I feel as if the issue still isn't resolved.

I'll try to keep this fairly succinct. My girl friend (Age 24) and I (Age 22) have been living together for a year and a half, we are pretty serious (have talked about marriage and kids). Recently, we have decided to slow things down and go on a ""break"" so she can get things sorted out and know for sure she wants to be with me. I of course didn't want this but felt like I needed to be supportive of it so she can be 100% certain of our relationship. The difficult thing is that we LIVE together, and I am still expected to treat her the same way I did before the break, minus giving her grief about going out/ not informing me of her plans. Long story short, last night she went and got dinner and drinks with her ex who she was with for 6 years prior to me. Later that night she called me (clearly intoxicated) asking if I would be upset if she stayed there because she was too drunk to drive the 30 minutes to our home. Now its almost 10A.M. the next day and still no word from her :/ I need advice on how I should handle this situation/ what I should be thinking about all this. Thanks guys!

For the past 2 month I'm hanging out with a girl from my class. I never really had the chance to really know her in class. So when we started to hang out and I really got to know who she really is I fell in love with her. I personally think she is perfection and literally can't stop thinking about her , but she is really insecure and isn't feeling well mentally for some time. I already told the people I trust the most about my crush. Including a friend of hers. But this is the first time I have a crush on someone. Normally I'm a person who tries to avoid crushes. But there was just something special about her. Because this is the first time I don't know what to do with it. I tried to forget my feelings, but I just couldn't get over her. I was thinking about confessing so I just could move on, but that would feel like just giving up this bond. So i wanted to ask reddit. There might be some things I probably forgot to tell but I had to write this fast.

I go to university abroad, and I was home over Easter holiday, where I spent 9-5 EVERY day without pay fixing both websites, shooting slides, making new promotional materials and setting up her social media.

I told her that she has GOT to send me pictures So I can do her social media. This past weekend, first weekend I'm back at school, senior year, in the midst of the end of all things, she starts sending me these joke pictures, pics of someone picking their feet in the store, underwear hanging from a string and at first I didn't know what was going on so I was mad. This ""send me pictures"" social media issue has been ONGOING and I didn't get a single picture for social media. I've been asking for the last year to just send pictures, to take 30 seconds and send me a picture because I can't do it while I'm 5,000 miles away. I finally sent her a message saying, ""Also, I know you were sending those toe picture and funny pictures as a joke, but I find it disrespectful when I'm coming to you from a business perspective TRYING to help turn things around. Why should I take thins seriously if you're not?"" Now she's mad at me, and won't speak to me in any way other than short clipped business way. I'm just sick of a grown woman acting like a child.

This may be quite long, so I apologize in advance. My boyfriend [20M] and I [20F] have been dating for nearly two years, with a brief break in April. I broke up with him then because I was unsure if I still loved him and was feeling trapped in the relationship (I had been having those feelings for two months prior). Soon after the breakup, I began to feel like I had made a mistake--mostly because it seemed foolish to leave when I had someone who really loved me. We got back together after two weeks and things were peachy for a little while. A month later I began to have the trapped feeling again, and it has only gotten worse. He asks to hang out often, but I usually make up an excuse and tell him that I can't make it because I don't really want to spend time with him. He always initiates sex and I often turn him down. He tells me he loves me and I just repeat it because that's what I'm ""supposed"" to say, but it feels so empty. He's asked me about our future a few times (recently and in the past); I know he wants to marry me eventually but I honestly cannot see him in my future. I really don't think I want to be in this relationship anymore, but I'm afraid to break up because I know how much it crushed him last time and I don't want to hurt him that badly again--especially so soon. I feel like shit all of the time because I know I shouldn't be having these feelings and it's so unfair to him. Should I try and fix this or just leave once and for all? I don't even know if I want to fix it, but I'd feel like such a bitch if I broke up with him some 5 months after we got back together.

I just moved away after college and we broke up because we've done the long distance thing before and it was hard. I'm also going through a time that I want to work on myself and a relationship feels like a safety net. Regardless, I love her, and she still loves me. Tonight we were talking, and I was explaining how when I get into a serious relationship, I want to feel secure and stable. Disagreements will happen, but fighting often and arguing to the point of seriously upsetting one another don't need to happen. I really love this girl, and there's so much to her that I think would be very satisfying long term, but I'm so tired of fighting and getting in spats. Is it unreasonable for me to expect stability from my significant other? She really is quite volatile. I want to keep things going, but only if things can get better. The option is definitely there if I decided to make a serious move, but I fear that she is toxic, and the problems we have might only get worse. It would be really hard for me to cut contact with her, because I love her, although sometimes I don't know if it's just because I'm so attached to her.

Im sorry if this is a little confusing, I've never put this down into words and its hard to express what Im saying :/ Ill answer any questions down below. I recently turned 18 and I received a phone call from my Tio from prison. He told me he was in the same unit as my father, and that my father wants to contact me and sister after 10 years. My sister immediately said no, but I'm a bit hesitant. My mom and dad split when I was 5 and they had an agreement that every summer he'd pick up my sister and I and take us to my abuelo's house. However, when he got remarried he told my sister and I he didnt need us anymore and then left. We found out a few years later that he was sent to prison, and just learned that he was in the same unit as my family (its a bit difficult to explain, but my family is technically considered a gang. I really dont want to go into specifics about that though.) He has been reaching out to my tios and asking them to convince me to write him because he misses us. The problem is I just had an uncle get released from prison, and he told me and my mom that my dad was trying to say he's from our neighborhood/family because of who my mom,sister and I are. Because all my tios know that he abandoned us and the other people from our neighborhood dont know him, they're calling him out and fighting with him and he had to be put into pc. My dad knows that if my mom and I say that he is my father and apart of my life my uncles would protect him, and I'm worried that is the only reason he's trying to reach out to me. I do not want to start an adult relationship with him if its only so he can be protected while he's in, but I miss my dad and I want to have some kind of relationship with him, even if we can only be friends.

I have been dating my boyfriend Jake for almost a year. We go to the same school. He competes for our school's powerlifting team, and is very good. Unfortunately for me, his obsession with the sport is starting to take over his life. He gets hurt a lot, and this past month he told me he found that sex irritates his hip. He decided that this meant we can't get have sex on days when he does squats, or the day before. This means no sex on Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Because we both have classes and he has trouble staying awake on Friday evenings, our sex life has gone from several times a week to once or twice per week. I would prefer to have a lot more sex, and this is frustrating to me, but I'm not sure how to approach him about it. How can I talk to him about this? I know I need to communicate my needs to him, but I have never been in a relationship before him and we have never had any problems so I'm new to this. I'm also not sure how to get to him because lifting weights means the whole world to him. It's so important to him that he keeps a framed picture of some Russian guy next to his bed that he claims has his world record, and he skips family events if they keep him away from the gym.

So, obviously I'm young, but hey, I'm still a junior going to a high school with this girl, let's call her Jenny. I've been friends with her since the start of this school year so ~6 Months. She got out of a relationship with her boyfriend around two months ago. She texted me and talked to me about it until she finally got over it. A couple weeks pass by and Jenny starts getting closer to me in class, we have class with each other every day. We start sitting next to each other, yeah no big deal. Another week passes and we're walking in the hallway and she grabs my arm, she interlocks it and I brush it off as nothing, she does the same thing after our next class and I start wondering. Over the next week, she starts hanging out with me more, I play lacrosse so I have practice all the time. On game day, Jenny takes my practice jersey and wears it around all day and then waits in the locker room for me, and we go hang out for a bit. We're sitting on a bench with a couple other mutual friends and she rests her head on my shoulder. Now, my doubts mostly come from the fact that Jenny is very outgoing and always makes up some lame excuse to ditch me when I ask to just hang out as friends on the weekends.

I'm also concerned about the age gap, since it falls out of the 'socially-acceptable-scale-thingy'. But only by 1 year. And also that I was kind of subscribed to that rule myself and actually think 19-20 *should* be my lower limit. Then again, I think we actually are a good match in that we might have similar interests (we met when I visited my old dojo), architecture and anime. I said yes to the date because of this, but I feel like I need to ask if I should pursue this as a relationship when I haven't really fallen for her the way I have for others.

Hey reddit, I will do my best to keep it short: I am dating a girl for a couple of months now and we harmonize perfectly in every aspect expect one: her fucking best friend. They spend a lot of time together (shit like watching movies in bed etc.) and talk about intimate details of our relationship (like our sex life and when we have an argument etc.). In fact when they hang out, they are like a couple expect they don´t have any sex (at least what I know). He also has a girlfriend and from what I heard a few broken relationships because the girls could not deal the fact of him spending so much time with his ""best girl-friend"". He is also protective as shit about her. My girlfriend always claim that she has absolutely zero sexual interest in him and thats why it works so well and the same for him (which I call 100% bullshit since they are both very attractive 19 year olds with hot bodies). So now we are dating for quite a time and it starts to get serious but I am thinking about ending this because of her best friend. I tried to talk to her many times about this and every time it ends in tears and ""please don´t let me choose between you both"" and ""you are both so important to me"". But honestly I am not ok with sharing my girlfriend with another dude and to know that every time we hang out all together he knows every little detail about our bedroom stories and problems. I would not have a problem if she talks to a girl best friend about this (since I also talk about everything with my best buddy). So either I am full of complexes and lack self esteem because I feel intimidated by her best friend or this is not normal and not worth the drama. Please reddit give me some opinion and advice on this, I feel bad about breaking up with her but I am afraid that the drama will go on the more serious our relationship goes.

I'm fine with that, but he's asking me to hang out every week or every second week, and I'd like to see him more on a once a month type basis. A long time ago he asked me out and though he swears he's over any sort of crush, sometimes I feel the dynamic remains to a slight extent. I don't want to be hanging out in a pseudo boyfriend-girlfriend capacity, which is what it feels like to me when we're getting dinner together all the time. We're at different life stages and I can't talk about girly stuff with him, plus in general I'm an introvert and probably wouldn't want to hang out that much even if he were a female friend. Final thing is there were a lot of toxic friendships in our group (long story involving a break-up), and he's still friends with everyone and therefore is a link back to all that drama (although there's no hard feelings, the rest of us have decided to go no contact with each other). How do I tactfully tell him this? I texted him a polite variation of the above a few days ago in an attempt to set boundaries and he responded ""I don't feel the same way, but everyone's different. I totally understand"", but now he's already asked to hang out again. Another problem is that he doesn't have a huge social life (at least, from what I can tell), so part of his motivation is just to hang out with *someone*, I think, so it's hard not to feel bad turning down his requests. At the same time, I'm thinking this dynamic isn't that healthy for either of us.

I've been afraid to post here because of my age but I have no one in my IRL world that I can ask about this. A little backstory first: so when I was 15, I dated an 18 year old who was pretty awful to me for all 5 months we were together. After he broke up with me, he refused to tell me why, and instead spread rumors about me around school (e.g. ""she got ugly once she cut all her hair off"" ""she was a drama queen"" etc.). I also found out that everything he ever told me was a lie and he only dated me to get closer to my best friend. I woke up to a series of texts from him that read (shortened and edited so you are actually able to read it): ""Hey Girl, I know I am the last mother f*cker you wanna talk to and I don't blame you. But it's Boy and I need to ask you a hardcore question. And I need your honest opinion. If I just talked to you and told you how I felt instead of not talking to you and holding back everything and blowing up on you, do you think we would've worked it out or were we bound to end? I deserve to know. Sorry for bothering you."" This is the first contact he has had with me since he said ""I'm breaking up with you"" and I'm conflicted as to how to respond. Part of me wants to let loose on him about how terrible he was, but the other, more responsible half wants to be an adult about this and speak level headedly. Do I blow up or show up?

Dear Reddit, Please help me out here because I'm really failing to understand. My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years total. I'm a full-time grad student. My boyfriend works as a consultant. We share expenses and we are definitely talking marriage and kids in the future. About a month ago, I found out that he had started a business entirely without telling me anything about it at all. I was absolutely stunned. He said that I should have asked more questions. He said that when he mentioned ""I'm going to lunch with x today,"" I should have realized that it meant that he was doing business. I told him that was completely unreasonable and it led to a huge argument. We fought a lot but in the end, he promised to keep me explicitly informed and involved in all major decisions in the future. Fast forward a month, he comes home with a brand new car. He told me he was looking to trade in his car, but he didn't inform me of ANYTHING else until he came home with the new car. This led to another huge fight. For the record, he can afford what he is doing; I am concerned about the lack of communication part. I just want to know... is this kind of thing normal in other couples? He makes many small decisions without my input, which is fine, but I consider a business and a car to be things you talk through with your SO. How do I approach this? He keeps promising to keep me informed and keeps failing to.

We've been dating for 4 months, and this is eating at me. I lied about having my bachelors in chemical engineering. It was too hard and I dropped out of college. When we started dating, just to play it cool, I told her I had my bachelors since she is working on her Master's thesis. I thought more of it as a fling and never thought this relationship would develop into anything serious. The more we spend time with each other, I uttered the words of love to her. And I actually want a serious relationship with her. I've made up stories and jokes about why I'm not doing anything with my (fake) degree. It's actually bothering me constantly, and honestly I have no idea how she would take it, if I tell her the truth. I am back in school, but taking some general classes slowly trying to find out what I want to get a degree in. Did I really ruin this entire relationship because of this lie?

I told myself that I would fix it by myself so that she wouldn't ever have to know. One day I was thinking long and hard about our future and I knew that I couldn't allow myself to lie to her any longer. She asked me when we first started dating if I looked and I told her that I used to but I wouldn't anymore. I tried to keep this promise but then I fell back into it and stayed that way for years. When I told her she was mortified and almost broke up with me on the spot, but didn't. We had been going to counseling for about 1-2 years now as a preventative measure and she agreed to go with me once again. After talking it over with our Psychologist, I was given tasks and tools that would help me overcome my problem and try to fix us. Fast forward to present day, I have been doing everything that the Psychologist has asked for me to do, I haven't looked once, and I have been telling my girlfriend the truth on everything. She still isn't happy (understandably) but she is now asking me questions like ""tell me everything that you looked at"". She tells me that it is part of her healing but I told her that as part of my healing I need to leave my past there and look forward to the future. Currently she doesn't want to speak to me unless I tell her. Its been really rocky and I either have been feeling completely emotionless towards her or depressed by myself. I usually am very optimistic about the future with her but lately I feel like she is just going to cut the cord and I feel like there is nothing left for me to give without hurting myself. Any insight, advice, or criticism would be greatly appreciated...

Hi all. We've been together just under a year - she's never done anything like this before. Yesterday my girlfriend went out and got blackout drunk the other night, kissed her gay male friend. One of her friends had a go at her for doing this as she didn't realise he was gay. My girlfriend then calls me drunkenly afterwards. Crying, saying that she's sorry she kissed him. The day after I've confronted her about it and she's obviously very very sorry. Has text her friends to find out if anything else happened and relayed that to me. I feel like this shouldn't be a big deal but at the same time it is... she kissed someone other than me, whilst drunk. Whilst she's obviously sorry and I love her to bits. I dunno what to do or if I'm being silly for being hurt over this?

This is a family friend I've previously barely ever talked to (not in a mean way, just in a 'we hang out with other people' way). Thus it made me do a double take when he very casually after saying hi at one of these gatherings said, 'Oh, I don't think I have your number, do I?'. I gave him my number, because it would have been rude not to. 1 month later, I get the text, 'Hey Apple_crumble1, this is [insert name] how have you been? Haven't seen you in a while :)' Now this is a little odd, because we barely ever see each other anyway, not like this is unusual. I sent a reply along the lines of 'Not bad, studying for exams mainly. You?', and a few minutes later there was a response like '[blah blah, talking about exams] Do your parents let you go out much, like Friday, Saturday nights, or are they very strict?' Is this a prelude to asking me out, or am I reading too much into idle conversation? I don't have much experience with this kind of thing. For the record, I'm not interested in him in that way in the slightest. If it is a prelude to a date, any advice on how to prevent such a request/let him down gently without directly saying 'I'm not interested'?

So this is my first post so I apologise up front about any format or grammar mistakes. My so (18f) and I (20m) have been together for a year and almost three months. This is a long time for us seeing as all previously all relationships before hand were much shorter. She went out of town to see her dad this weekend and week talked on the phone last night, normal night for us. She came out and told me that for the past month or two she had been wanting to break up and that she has only stayed with me so far to make me happy. I've come to the conclusion that I know she is the person that I am in love with, but she says she is unsure of her feelings for me anymore. I asked her to wait about the break up until she is back in town because this is a big decision and that not something that should be done over the phone. So reddit can you give me some advice?

This past weekend my girlfriend of three years went to her college homecoming and I spent the weekend at home. On Saturday I found myself extremely bored and all of my friends were busy, so I went for a drive to kill time until one of them could hang later. During this drive I just listened to music and thought.... I recognized that I hate being home and really want to go live life because I'm 22. I wanna live back in the city (where college was) with my friends and have tons to do again. I'm just becoming very unhappy at home and as I'm applying for tons of jobs, just want to make sure that I don't pass up any decisions or opportunities. My GF of three years works for her family's business and plans to continue it with no real flexibility on leaving the area. We have been very close friends for around 8 or 9 years now and started dating 3 years ago. I've been starting to get frustrated because we still haven't had sex yet and now that we are both living at home again there is pretty much 0 alone time. I think that the living situation is making me more frustrated about no sex and the entire relationship, but with my new feelings towards my own life, I feel like our relationship has hit quite the standstill and we've grown apart or differently. I'm now noticing major differences with our interests and what's important to us individually. I love my girlfriend, and care about her a lot. Our relationship has been great, but considering everything I'm feeling, I'm curious if it's still the best thing for me? I don't necessarily want to break up, but I sure as hell don't want to miss opportunities or throw away my 20's in my hometown. Between this and no-sex, I just don't know if I can go on doing this. The whole thing has me feeling really confused, upset, worried and nervous. I'm not sure what to do or how to handle it. Part of me feels like I should wait and see where I get a job or plan to live before making any decisions because with that might come improvement to our relationship, but I'm just looking for some advice and opinions...

My ex and I had a fairly rocky break up, it didn't end because we stopped loving each other but for other reasons. We were trying to stay friends but communicating quickly died down as she got a new boyfriend fairly quick and we didn't speak for about a year and a half. Then suddenly out of nowhere right before Christmas she sends me a message on Facebook asking how I'm doing and that it is so nice to talk to me again. We talk for a good hour or so before she says she should go to bed because she's got work, but before she leaves she asks if I still have the same number and I say that I do and she says ""well here's mine in case you lost it: XXXXXXXXXXX. Good night, hope we can talk again soon :)"" And that was that, I didn't try talking to her since she had a boyfriend and I didn't want to be that annoying ex so a few more months went by and in March she suddenly messaged me again saying she saw something on TV that reminded me of her and we spoke for a few hours before she went to bed. I checked her profile and noticed suddenly that it no longer said she was in a relationship and I remembered she changed her profile picture to one of just her a few weeks back. After this I tried initiating conversation a few times, she took about 2 days to respond the first time, but I didn't mind. But I noticed that her messages seemed quite short and uninterested with the exception of a few and she''s not initiating any conversations...so...what gives?

I met my wife in college and we hit it off pretty quickly. I'm a laid back career-minded individual and my wife is more of a fun-loving type A. I was raised in a family that has lived on both ends of the economic spectrum. We've been so poor that we were near homeless, and we've also been a family making a decent 6 figure wage. My wife was raised in a family that has always been well off, as her dad is a VP at a large company. Her mother has always been a stay at home mom, as her dad's income was more than enough for the family. I come from a home where everyone has worked since they were first able. We've been together a total of 7 years, and we started together in a tiny one bedroom apartment in college. She didn't complain when we lived there, but she understandably said she wanted to have more space. Since then, I've gotten a career and make pretty good money for my age. I showed her the houses that were available for what we make after budgeting and she wasn't satisfied. I told her that if she was willing to work, we could move into a large home, so she got a job. Since then she has decided that she hates work and isn't cut out for it. She talks about how much she hates it at least 2-3 times a week. I told her she could quit and we could move some place smaller, but she wants to have her cake and eat it too; she refuses to accept the idea that we'd have to move into a smaller home. I told her as long as she wants to live in a large house, we have to both be working. I've talked to her about getting a different job. I talked to her about doing her resume, helping her find another career, but she isn't interested. The only acceptable outcome for her is to not have to work but live in a house we cannot afford (which I am unwilling to put us through). How do I get through to her?

Throwaway since my girlfriend occasionally browses reddit. We have been together for a little over two years. We met online when we first began dating. I was baffled that someone as good looking as her was on a dating website. She is easily a 10/10, skinny, super long brown hair, thick eyelashes, rosy cheeks and smooth skin. At least that's what i thought. I found out within the first month of us dating that her hair is a wig. For the first 6 months, she tried to keep it on as much as possible, but had to take it off to sleep. She has alopecia and her real hair is very short and is in fact bald in some places. I was okay with this.. Until then she started removing her makeup too. Totally different person. She has very uneven toned skin, literally no eyebrows, and almost no eyelashes. If you saw her without her wig and makeup you would think she was actually a different girl. At first these things didn't bother me, until recently. I know she is VERY self conscious of the way she looks, which is why she does herself up real nice, so i could never bring it up. It is annoying to see pictures of her and have memories of her as this beautiful princess, but come home to a girl who looks nothing like what i thought. I know this sounds shallow but i need some advice. I rarely see her looking nice anymore, as now she feels comfortable enough to be bare-faced and wiggless around me all the time. Thanks.

Hello Reddit! Last october I told this girl my feelings towards her, but her response was what I've known but I had a lot to go through so I went along. Yes, it was a No. We were really close best friends, but for the past 2 years I felt a lot more( this as background). We've known each other for 9 years now, we were dating at the very beginning. I told her that I can't see her in order to help myself forget and move on, so I asked her not to write me or call me. Today is/was my birthday, and she wrote me, and told me the she's sorry to break my wish, but it's my birthday so she had to write. It pains me, I have to admit that she wrote me, I feel very down once again. The question I want to ask is, whether I should her write back anything at all or no?

In a nutshell, I [21M] have a coworker at the hookah lounge we work at. We normally don't work together these days (I work Mon-weds, she [19F] works Fri-Sun), but I stop by and visit at least once a week. I was broken up with by a girl I was in a very serious relationship with over a year ago, and honestly, my coworker is the first person since that has made me feel legitimately okay again. She's gorgeous, and the most caring and sweet person in the world. I'm always extremely comfortable with her, and since the day she started working we've both been constantly poking fun at each other (Water pistols, poking jokes at each other, etc). So I guess it basically narrows down to a few major factors, that I'd really like some advice/pointers on: *I've no idea how to even go about asking her out these days; my last relationship just kinda happened *I'm still not sure if it would be a good idea, even if we do normally never work with each other So, what does Reddit think about this situation?

Exactly what the title says. He was violent, and made me feel crazy. He never left marks that people could see. He was your typical manipulative, mean, narcissistic ex-bf. The kind your parents warn you about. I was with him for one year. I saw how he treated his girlfriends prior to me, and still dated him anyway. I had to have my older brothers and cops present in order to break up with him safely. We dated over five years ago. He has now been with this girl for a year or so I think. They moved together to a very far away part of my country where neither of them know anyone. I can see the little changes in her, even through her mostly-private FB page. She wears less makeup now, she doesn't post as many selifes, her friends list has dwindled. I don't have any lingering feelings for my ex, AT ALL. Any feelings at all would be pity and anger. I worry about her. I worry that she is trapped, the way that I was and that she has no one around to help her. Is it wrong of me to check on her FB sometimes? Is it unhealthy? I mean, I know it's unhealthy and their relationship isn't my problem, but, I know how she must be feeling, or will be feeling soon. How do I stop myself from worrying about her?

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, sorry! Recently I seem to be digging myself a hole and falling deeper into a more stressed state of mind.

My girlfriend and I just broke up because she wanted to be free for college, and I am looking for a long term (monogamous) relationship. A little backstory: My exgirlfriend and I founded our relationship on the thought of being life partners. She broke up with me after a year and 1/2 because she wants to be a ""bad girl"" and have fun in college and not be tied down. All I ever want is to find my life partner and enjoy life in a relationship. I know I am young to want that, but I don't enjoy hooking up and meaningless sex and relationships. The last year and 1/2 I was the happiest I have ever been because I love everything that goes along with a long term relationship. I enjoy parties but only if my SO is there, I enjoy everything that couples do, I love being loved by someone unconditionally, basically everything that comes along with being a couple I enjoy. I am going to be a freshman in college this fall and since the ending of my previous relationship all I want is another one, with someone who wants the same things I want. My biggest fear is that in college many people are going to be looking to have fun and not looking to be in a long term relationship. Just a few questions. Please share your stories and opinions as openly as only redditers are known to do, just do so positively: 1) Are there people in college looking for the same thing that I am? 2) What can I do to prevent myself from hopping into a relationship that isn't right for me because I am desperate to be in a relationship? 3) Has this happened to anyone else? (Success Stories?) My hope is for these comments to re-assure me and everyone else reading about what great things are out there. I would like this to be a light in the dark compared to most of the negative posts on this thread. Please limit comments to constructive criticism and positive comments/stories. Thank you.

Oddly enough, he is incredibly level-headed, calm and abnormally intelligent. We believe he isn't oblivious to some of her behavior but lets it go on without formally addressing it with her. We have held our tongues for years to avoid an uncomfortable situation, but some of us are hitting a breaking point. What is the best way to handle this? I should also mention that my cousin and I have been very close since we were kids and live in the same area, so this is someone I see frequently.

Ive had my first gay relationship with a guy who is a bit younger than me. Aside from the age difference we have a lot in common and the last 4 months have been the happiest Ive ever been. The problem is that I was away out of town for 3 weeks. We had not been official or exclusive, and since I returned he said he's met someone else. I told him how I felt about him, and he said the reason was that he didn't think I wanted anything serious. After a lot of discusion, he then said that he would end it with the new guy. Fast forward two weeks, and we've had lots of conversations and crying and making up, but he's chosen the other guy - who unbeknown to any of us until right now is an acquiantance of mine. When we were together he used to say the most loving, kind things, and right up until 2 weeks ago was still calling me babe and sending sweet messages. I guess, since it's my first realtionship, I wanted to know what you guys thought of the possibility that we'd get back together? Do these things happen? Or is that it? He says he never wants to lose me as a friend, and I don't want to lose him. The other guy is 24. I've spent all day crying over this. I never thought I'd get so emotional.

So my GF broke up with me today and was very disrespectful, as she was the last time she dumped me. This makes the 4th time she's dumped me. But she always comes back within a week. She has generalized anxiety disorder and possibly PTSD from childhood abuse. I can handle the breakups but i cannot handle the disrespect. I've decided i cannot get back together with her. I love her and wish we could be together. But i can't let her treat me this way. it damages my respect for her when she disrespects me without cause, and it causes me alot of stress too. My question is; can we still be friends? I'm very tempted to ask to be 'friends with benefits' as well. not because i enjoy our sex (i don't really enjoy any sex very much lol) but more so because i am still in love with her... This seems like a bad idea and a recipe for dysfunction... but it is very tempting. a way of being with her without her being able to break up with me... she is very respectful when we're together. and regrets her disrespect afterwards. and she genuinely loves me and misses me. But her GAD kicks in when thinking about the future and she lashes out at me and runs away. Before inevitably recanting... any thoughts or anecdotes would be appreciated

Ok, so my girlfriend of 3 years and myself broke up two and a half months ago. Two months later I met a new girl (""Sally""). We hit it off quickly and hung out a ton for three weeks. But over the last week, I noticed I was unintentionally pushing myself away. Fast forward to last weekend and I pretty much told her I wasn't ready to date. I made her cry and I feel horrible. I'm a good guy and rarely am the one ending things. I feel bad because I feel like it may have worked if the timing was different. At the time we started hanging out I think I was trying to tell myself I was ready. But after hanging out, getting attached, getting comfortable, it was just hitting me as too much to fast. I feel horrible sleeping with her and leading her on. But I felt I had to be honest as soon as I began feeling uneasy. Did I make the wrong decision? Should I have waited longer to see what happens?

We met about a year ago through some on-campus activities and we have become very close in the interim. We are bordering on ""best friend"" status if you will...we share our problems and a lot of other fairly personal stuff with each other, talk and text often, and spend quite a bit of time together at social gatherings. I guess the issue is that I'm fairly certain she isn't interested. I'm not her type from what I've gathered and was basically told I've been ""friendzoned"" in a roundabout way. She is out of my league as well if I'm honest. And yet, knowing all of this, I am still developing (or perhaps it would be better to say *have developed*) feelings. I would love to have a deeper relationship. I worry about her, and although I have absolutely no right and I know it, it annoys me when she hangs on other guys at parties and such and they hit on her, or talks to me too much about men she's interested in. I'm not willing to say anything because I don't want to damage our friendship so I've taken a hands-off approach, even as I worry myself to death and try to keep an eye on her (she tends to drink a bit too much and get fairly handsy at parties so a lot of guys take that as an invitation even when it isn't.)

Apparently I'm just a ""classy motherfucker"" becuase I don't try anything while she's messed up and take care of her. I'm not sure how I should take that either. So ya I guess I'm just frustrated and confused. I'm not sure how I should be handling the situation and my feelings towards her. It's kinda maddening.

I made an account for this post because it is driving me crazy. First a little background. Both of us come from mildly religious families and though we haven't explicitly talked about it, we would both like to wait to have sex until we're married. We've been dating for a little over 8 months and everything else about the relationship is great. Sometimes in the past, we have gotten a little intimate(if we are just laying together in bed etc.) with some sexual activity such as breast play or manual stimulation and she loves it. She really gets into it and we both have our boundaries for what kind of sexual activity we want before we're married, but this is something we both get into. She's even orgasmed a few times just from stimulation through her clothes. Anyway I think its a great time but recently(the past few weeks) she's pulled away from that sort of thing massively. She doesn't want any of that anymore and she won't kiss me much either. Intimacy is important for me and I asked her about it before, to which she responded that she just doesn't want to kiss me all the time and was angry that I brought it up. She doesn't want to talk about it and makes me feel bad every time I try to talk about it, saying that I always find something to complain about. This is killing me because I always try to initiate even just kissing and she rejects me every time. I don't know how to tell her this is bothering me without her thinking I'm just complaining about everything, and I don't know if there's anything I could do to help the situation.

Okay Redditors, There she was, the most beautiful (I mean, she was dangerously attractive) girl I'd laid eyes on. I took a class with her but never imagined she'd be interested so I never said much to her. She messages me the last week of class, out of nowhere, to tell me how attracted she is to me and how intelligent she thinks I am. I'm floored because, frankly, this girl is way out of my league. So I've seen her a few times in the past 2-3 weeks since this happened. She's really cool, but we have huge differences. I'm pretty devoutly religious and she really has no clue what she believes right now. She's a bit wilder than I am too, in terms of partying and alcohol and such. I'm pretty open-minded, so it's been fun and challenging (enjoyably so) to be with someone so different than me. The more I'm getting to know her, though, I'm growing doubtful of what steps to take. She's depressed, and says she feels no purpose (religious or otherwise) in life. I've been there before and I'm trying to show her love and support through this, but she's pushing me away. We had a date planned later this week that she thinks we should call off. She says she's attracted to me but often tries to convince me that she's no good for me, and that she's undeserving of my love. What should I do? Her happiness and wellbeing is most important to me, and I'm not sure how to extricate that from romantic implications. Work your magic, Reddit.

So this guy who I've liked for some time asked me to hang out last week - we went out to dinner, hung out for awhile later, he seemed like he really wanted to continue talking (as did I) so we went back to my room as well and talked further. He had also asked me to get coffee the week before that, and that was really fun too. However, nothing happened physically - we didn't even hug. I may have given off some standoffish vibes. He kept saying that we should meet up, go see a movie together, hang out over the summer, that I should visit him in his dorm, etc. He also was complimenting me a lot. Overall it seemed like a date, and that he was interested. Looking back, I may not have seemed super interested since I didn't try to hug him, didn't compliment him a ton, etc. The reality is, though, that I really like him, but am unfortunately not very good at showing it. Anyway, we hung out again yesterday (I asked him to get dinner), and things seemed kind of different. We had a nice conversation as always, lots of laughter, but it just seemed like he was being more platonic. I was going to invite him to do something with me afterwards, but he mentioned he had to go study so I didn't. Every time we've hung out previously he's ended by saying we should hang out again, but he didn't this time. I guess I also walked away kind of quickly from him at the end. Sigh, I keep doing that. Probably the underlying problem here is that I'm just pretty shy. Has he lost interest? Should I try to pursue him, or is it too late? I'm considering just straight up telling him that I like him, but I don't know if the timing is now wrong.

I guess I just would like to talk about how I feel and see if this is normal. Quick back story, I am 24/m and GF is 22, we have been dating for 2 years 7 months, this is my third long term GF and I am her first. This is my longest relationship and I always do the breaking up. Things just start irritating me more, I start thinking about how I could be happier and I notice that I start to project what my PERFECT girl qualities would be on other women, just women I see on the street or at work and imagine how I would be so much happier with that person, and how I am so unhappy with my current GF which lead me to the eventual break up. I never look back either. It is happening now with my current GF. She is amazing and like no other girl I dated, she is so smart (3.89 GPA and a Bio major from a good school and will be in med school next year), driven, funny, and BEAUTIFUL! But lately I have started to get those feelings and we have been fighting more. She is a very, idk how to put it, cold hearted? Not very emotional towards me, constantly takes things out on me during school (we barely talk during finals week for her because she is so stressed) and she has been saying things that make me think she really isn't that nice of a person inside. I am in grad school with a BA in sociology, and many times before she has said rude/condescending remarks about my schooling and career goals (law enforcement after grad school). She gets this behavior from her parents, mainly her mother, just very fake and mean spirited people, but extremely nice on the outside. I feel guilty thinking like this because I do love her and don't want to leave her, but then another part of me does and I am so torn apart.

About 15 years ago my parents bought a business together. Due to a combination of factors (recession, competition moving in) the business is no longer profitable. They opened a side business about two years ago that is profitable but a competitor just announced they are opening next year. Both my parents work 60+ hour a week, are in their 60s and are barely drawing salaries from the company. This is not sustainable. My biggest fear (and it is selfish) is one of them works themselves into a heart attack, etc and I have to return home and figure out what to do with a failing business. I am an only child so when (and its not if, its when) something happens it will be entirely on me to figure out what to do. Also in that scenario there would be no luxury of time - without both of them working 60+ hours a week the place would come to a halt almost immediately. I'm feeling pretty paralyzed and stressed by this scenario. I would like to pro-actively talk with my dad this weekend about what to do. My mom has asked me to do this as she does not think she can keep going much longer. I think the first step is having them explore their options - talk to their lawyer and accountant about what it would really mean for them if they declared Bankruptcy (could they keep the house, etc). I realize this is going to be very painful and tough but at least having that information is the first step in figuring out a solution. Lets say they lose their retirement accounts in bankruptcy. It would be awful, but there is no end of sight of them retiring with their current jobs. At least if they were free from it they could get true 9-5 jobs with less stress and continue working with an actual income. I'm wondering if anyone on here has suggestions about how to structure this conversation? I'm worried my dad will view me bringing this up as calling him a failure, etc. Any help would be appreciated.

My girlfriend and I are distant, but *we live on the same campus*, and it's killing me. I'm going to convey the situation in a series of small rants that have built up (that I haven't told her about yet (but I will)). Here they go: * Some days I feel loved, and other days I feel like I'm a complete thorn in her side. Like I have to pay her to show affection. * She says that she's been really stressed about school lately, and I understand that, because I am also stressed and very busy, but we've only hung out 4 times since the beginning of the semester. And I know that if she would even remotely seem interested, that I would make time for her. At this point, I've given up asking her to hang out or do anything. * We haven't had sex in ages, and when I told her I wanted to try to get more physical again, she told me she probably wasn't going to feel like having sex any time soon. What..? * At the same time, she'll tweet about how hot she thinks a certain celebrity is, etc. I know that sounds petty, and if the circumstances were different, I would agree. But reading stuff like that from a girl that can't seem to do anything with me is both hurtful and infuriating. -- I understand that I need to talk to her, and that this seems partly like a communication issue; I am going to talk to her. I'm not looking for someone to tell me to work on communication. I am trying to get an idea of what you guys and gals think is going on, and what you would do, and how you would react in my position.

So, I agreed to go on a date with a girl I've known for about a month because she asked me just to at least try things out and that's sort of my ethos in life, just try things to see if they work. Problem is, there really is a massive difference between us, for example she is very into drugs and generally lives life on the edge whereas I am against them and fairly boring. As far as I can see the only similarity between us is our music taste. I don't find her personality very attractive, or her physically very attractive. I'm considering cancelling it. What's the right thing to do? Cancel now so she doesn't get her hopes up, or go ahead with it whilst trying to keep an open mind by essentially knowing the outcome and then having to tell her it's a definite no? The last thing I want to do is hurt her feelings D=

I've been with my boyfriend for about a year now, and we see each other about once a week with lots of texting in between. Texting is my least preferred method of conversation, but its the fastest and most consistent method we have of communication. I really like talking on the phone, but he can't stand it and tries to avoid making any phone calls he can. He is a great guy who answers my calls the few times I've made them. About a month ago, I brought all this up with him and asked if it were possible to have a ten minute phone call with him every now and then to replace some texting we do. He wasn't really on board but decided to try it. We had one extremely tense five minute conversation where he admitted it was only to please me, and then hung up. I felt like crap and haven't asked him for another phone call again. He hasn't called since, but continued like it never happened I want to keep this relationship, but some days texts aren't giving me the connection I need with him. Asking him to call me just makes me feel like the most horrible girlfriend ever and ends with a tense, uncomfortable conversation anyway. Is there any middle ground or should I just cope with the texts?

I can't decide if I should try to be friends at all with my ex. We broke up in October after I left for college and he stayed home. Since then there hasn't really been a clean break (still have flirted and hooked up when i'm home) but he has told me several times, ""I've changed, I want to be single and do my own thing. I still care about you and there's still a special bond, just not romantic"" It hurts every time. But I don't really want a relationship either. I just don't want to let go of the past, so I'm afraid of really breaking things off (no contact style) and not seeing him over the summer (even though he would still live in a different town, just closer) I just don't know if it's worth the stress or if it's what I really want.

So my best friend and I have been friends for 11 years and she has been with her fiance for 5 years and he has always not liked the idea of us hanging out alone, but he has put up with it because he doesn't want to force her to choose her friends. They are getting kicked out of the room they rent and have to find a new place to live (the owner of their house is selling and the new owner doesn't want any tenants there) and I am looking for a new place to move into for work reasons so there was talk about us getting a 2 bedroom apartment because it would be cheaper to split the costs. My best friend is all for it, but since her fiance doesn't really like us hanging out alone together he has been begrudgingly accepting of the idea until recently he said he doesn't want to do it and she can tell he's getting more annoyed when we hang out. She is annoyed because she doesn't see why he is being stubborn and getting upset, I kind of understand his position though I am no threat to their relationship. My question is should I ask to speak with him, just the two of us to hash things out? Since they have been together I think him and I have spent a accumulative time of less than an hour talking together without her in the conversation so I am thinking that if we can have a serious talk and get his concerns out in the open he may feel better, but I don't want to harm their relationship because I know she loves him. (A side not is since we have been friends I have lost 120lbs and in a conversation they had she said that I am more attractive than I was when we met, in the context of I don't have a very successful dating life when it comes to asking girls out and she was saying that she was surprised it didn't get a lot better after I lost the weight.)

We broke up in June over text then made it official in Sept of this year. We broke up because of long distance after college opportunities separated us.

Well I have gone out of state to be with family and friends considering it is the holiday season. When I tell her I am hanging out with a friend she always jump the gun and thinks I am seeing someone special. In her round about way she has told me that if I am seeing someone that she won't text me anymore. Also, for some odd reason she chooses not to communicate via phone, Skype, or in person. We have met twice in person and both visits ended well with a warm hug and great conversations. I'm not sure what is going on considering we still share two dogs, share a few accounts, and we both have not deleted the thousands of pictures we have.

So I started work at a Spanish resterant last night as a KP (cleaning dishes and stuff) which is fine. However, my two collegues [18/m] and [26/m] make me feel uncomfortable. When I told them my age, the older of the two started trying to set me up with the one my age, asking if I wanted to go for a drink. I took this lightheartedly and they then asked if I was single, to which I replied ""no, I have a girlfriend"", but they continued, with the younger one saying that he ""still has a chance"". There was also a lot of vulgar talk about their sex life and genitals. This pretty much continued throughout the whole shift, with the two making jokes about the younger one going out with me, and when it was time to leave, he offered repeatedly to drive me home, even though I insisted that my dad was picking me up. The whole thing just seemed a bit much for my first day and I have my next shift tonight. Am I just overly sensitive? Or is this ""banter"" something to worry about?

I've barely started talking to and hanging out with this girl that went to the same high school as I did. Although we knew of each other's existence and we were friends in bunch of social media, we never talked until couple weeks ago.

Last weekend, I invited her to watch the Avengers with me and then invited her over to my friend's kick back during the Manny vs Floyd night. She is super willing to hanging out with me even though she's somewhat shy and she doesn't know any of my friends and barely knows me. In fact, she's down to hanging out some more this week! The part that confuses me is the way she texts! In the past, I usually looked at texting behavior to see if the girl is interested in me or not. (Slow replies,blunt messages) This girl however writes long ass paragraph texts and genuinely seems like she's interested in talking by the looks of her texts! BUT it's like she travels into another dimension without her phone after every reply. She takes at least average of 30 minutes to reply and sometimes just doesn't even reply at all. Can this just be her texting style? Am I over analyzing things? I just don't want all of this to end up going to the friendzone. lmao

Her exact words were ""I just want to be alone so I can figure out what I want with everything in my life without anybody or anything swaying my decision one way or the other so I think we should break up for a little while."" She also said she felt bad because she knew she was being really distant and didn't think I deserved that and didn't want me to think that's how a girlfriend should act. I understand that for the most part. However, she's called me since then to check on me and see how I was doing.

I have been dating my gf for 6 months, she is the love of my life. However, I just haven't been very satisfied with our sex life. In my previous relationship (lasted 3 years) my gf and I quickly got into a lot of kinkyness in our sex life (tying each other up, punishment spanking and paddlings, watching porn together, slapping each other during sex, rape fantasies, etc.) that I came to enjoy so much. My ex gf also had a strong interest in rape fantasies - I was reluctant at first but a lot of our sex involved kidnapping/rape scenarios where she pretended to resist. We also had normal vanilla sex, but it was about 50% of the time with the kinky stuff. We experimented together, I was the first person she had had sex with, so we developed these kinks as we dated. My current gf is not like this at all, she isn't as sexual (though still loves it) and we have not tried anything kinky. She has said she would be open to it, but I am very afraid to suggest anything as I know she has been raped in the past and also was sexually abused in her childhood and am really afraid of crossing a line or creating flashbacks or anything for her. But after my experiences with my ex girlfriend, I am not finding myself very satisfied with only regular vanilla sex. What can I do? Is there a way I can bring this stuff up without offending my gf? Obviously I don't want to say ""my ex and I used to do this stuff..."" nor do I want to remind her of anything bad from her past. I'm at a loss, any advice? Thank-you.

As seen in the title, my best friend killed himself yesterday - I've known him since I was six. On top of that, I lost my younger brother to a rock climbing accident 18 months ago. He was 19 and he was my only brother. I don't really want to go in to many details about either death since that is not what this post is about. I've been with my girlfriend for a little over a year. I met her about four months after my brother died and she provided support and friendship I needed, which since has blossomed into a deep mutual love. We were walking around the city last night. It was a beautiful night. I wanted to buy a shitty bottle of red zinfandel at a Rite Aid. I almost did too. Before I went into the store, I checked my email and saw that my best friends step-dad contacted me. He said to call him immediately - I knew exactly what phone call I was about to make. Dave had killed himself. With my brother, she was four months late to the party, but now she had front row tickets to the live show. In the last 24 hours, she has been an incredible support. I've used whatever energy I could muster in a feeble attempt to reassure her that this will not destroy the relationship. I know what grief is. I've been through it, although now it is compounded, which is why I reach out to you guys. This will not destroy me for I am stronger than it.

Hi Reddit, I'll start by saying both me and my gf have been together about a year and are in our early 20's, both still living at home with our parents. This past weekend my girlfriend and I were hanging out and she was in the middle of an unrelated argument with her dad via text message. He was also unhappy with how much she had been away from home and driving over to my house to hangout rather than me going to her house. He texted her saying ""OP should man up, grow some balls, and drive"". I wasn't supposed to see the text message but she was reading other messages off to me and they were on the screen. I asked GF if she felt like I didn't drive enough, and I never minded driving to come see her, she said she had no issue with anything. She usually wants to get out of her house, and my house is usually quiet and we have privacy. Whenever I ask her my house or yours she usually wants to come here. I have never had an issue with her dad before this incident but I feel like his words were quite harsh, and told my girlfriend I no longer felt welcome in her parents house, but I would drive and pick her up/drop her off. She told me she understood but hoped with time I would re-evaluate. I told her I know it puts her in a shitty situation and I don't want to strain her relationship with her dad but I felt disrespected and don't want to be around him anymore. I understand that I was never supposed to see that message but saying that behind someone's back is rude. Have I been over sensitive about the whole situation? I'll have to see him again eventually, how do I handle that situation?

Hey guys, I've known this girl for almost a year, and we have hit it off every time we were together in a group setting. We both got out of relationships this summer, and I invited her out for coffee. We clicked, and we had a really good time. I ended up at a frosh party with a buddy of mine, and the girl was there with her drunk friend. We hang out the whole night, and end up all drinking and dancing together. Her drunk friend said that she talks about me a bunch, and showed her pics of me. That made my night. Near the end of the night, her friend says 'it's a shame she likes (your friend)'. The girl then tells her friend to shut up, and apologies. The dude she likes and I are close, but don't talk that often anymore. He is also her partner for a competition this year. He was mine last year. The party ended 30 minutes later, we exchanged info with her friend and went home. I sent her a couple snaps today, but haven't gotten anything back. What can I do at this point? I just recovered from a really tough breakup, and I really thought I had a shot with this girl.

This is an incredibly difficult thing for me to talk about and have really done my best to hide it. My father left our family home when I was 7, my younger siblings (2M & 1F) . I remember him being EXTREMELY abusive towards my mother, many time nearly killing her. He was in and out of our lives to varying degrees as children until he finally stopped communicating with us entirely. That in itself was incredibly traumatic but got much worse when I was 18. My mother had been talking to law enforcement for a few months and wanted to let us know what was going on before we saw it in court newspapers. When my mother lived with my father they moved to a new city where she had no support system, and he and two other men forced her into prostitution. If she refused, she would be beaten, if she didn't make enough money, she would be beaten. She went to the police and all they saw was a prostitute and had no interest in helping her. The trial resulting in convictions for all 3 men. They are currently out of jail while they appeal the finding of the case. I recently found him by accident on social media and have been confronted with intense feelings I do not fully understand and feel I need to let him know how this has affected me and my family and how seeing them suffer has further affected me. I would appreciate any feedback or advice, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I'm a 20 year old girl, living in an apartment with my boyfriend. I used to be a lot more physically fit than I am now, and I've gained about 30 pounds since I started college. It's not like I have terrible self esteem over this, but I'd still like to go back to how I used to look. My boyfriend thinks I look fine and don't need to worry about it. I started a workout routine over the last summer, and am starting to take up running this spring. Today I bought 80 dollar running shoes (Vibrams, to be specific) so that I could run in as healthy a way as possible (I've had knee, ankle and foot injuries all on the same leg in the past and want to play it safe). Also, I wanted motivate myself to dedicate to running by investing something into it. The issue is, I came home from buying the shoes and my boyfriend was really upset that I spent so much money on something so pointless (since he doesn't think I need to work out in the first place). Do you think he was justified? How can we reach an agreement about my body image, working out etc?

Hey reddit, So I broke up with my GF recently. She dumped me (not a blowup, but more of I stopped paying attention), but then couldn't leave me alone, and still wanted me in her life some way. I didn't know what I really wanted, and did not feel like doing the same. Bottom line is we are finally going to be no contact, and she does not want me in her life now she says. She was my first love and GF, and I was pretty miserable relationship wise before her. I had never really dated, been intimate, or even had sex before her. I learned so much with her about who I am, and what goes into being with another person. Now with us over (at least for the near term), I am realizing it won't be so simple to get over her. I miss a lot about her, but definitely believe splitting would be good for both us for personal growth. I have had some girls come onto me since we broke up, and realize that finding someone else can be hard, which is why so many people run back to what they know. I have never really been into dating, but am social enough in casual situations to feel comfortable. I don't use online sites or anything, nor do I want to as I still think digital dating/hookups are kind of weird. How did anyone here deal with meeting someone else/dating after their first breakup? And did you wait a while before trying to get close to someone else? I believe in the when you stop looking you'll find it philosophy, but know you still have to have your eyes open so to speak. Any input is helpful, especially from a woman's perspective!

Hello, I'm a 21 years old male. I'm dating a 19 years old girl. Let's call her X. We used to date some time ago but she was spending less and less time with me. I wasn't ok with that and she broke up with me. She said she ""didn't feel it anymore"" and we went our ways. I fell for her so it hurt me, really, really badly. I made a fool of myself trying to get back with her. I even told her I love her. Nothing worked. I cringe whenever I think of that. Anyway. 3 or 4 months after that break up we meet again. We go out once, twice and we kinda started dating. It's been a month and a half. Maybe more now. We see each other only once or twice a week. Our ""dates"" look so fucking miserable, we see each for 2 or 3 hours only. She doesn't have time. She's always busy. I feel like I'm not even on a second place in her life. I feel like I'm somewhere down there on the dark bottom of the list. We haven't talked about what changed since the break up. We talked about her lack of time for me, she said that she was always busy and that's a part of her personality. That I should take a note on that. How do I fix things? Because for now I feel they're broken. She wants to date me, I want to date her, so why there must a fucking problem...? Am I supposed to talk to her about what changed since ""break up""? Should I made my expectations clear? Or... yeah, what?

Sorry of my grammar error and title is unclear, but I need you guys help soon as possible. After break up for 2 years relationship with my ex of having heavy arguments and suddenly attempting sexual abuse to me (atleast he stops that he realize I was not into it). I left his house (later break up with him) and got everything what I can, except my bike.. It sounds ridiculous, but I really do miss my bike since i'm poor to get another one. So for whole long emailing trying to make it appointment. First it was original for meeting up at the station where all people are around (because of my safety reason). But today, he cannot do it suddenly because of his emotional and it would be more meeting up outside at his house for leaving my bike. And finally he said he'll go somewhere else. So I made the time and then later to get the bike. But he mention the location where I usually go there with my bike to travel all the way back to home. Atleast I have my back up plan just in any case of my safety reason (because both my mother and me felt he'll go making a drama in his forcing seeing me), but the question is.. He's regaining his emotional after break up, but I still felt he's unstable now and certainly hope not that he'll do something stupid. The question is, is there any danger of emotionally unstable people information list that I should know about it? He has a history from his mother side of psychological problems.

In all my relationships, I've been the breaker. Despite this, I find myself over involved with my exes. Usually things will be fine until she moves on. After that I'm jealous and angry. What's wrong with me? And do I need to block all communication with my most current ex? We've dated on and off for a year and a half. Dating on and off is also a theme in my relationships. I'm M21 and she's F19. We broke up for good (at least I intend it to be that way) recently and I thought we'd be able to be friends. I was with her a bit ago when she mentioned ""talking to people"" and I freaked out. I can't help but feel jealous. I had to leave in order to avoid making an ass out of myself and now I'm considering if I need to block all communications for my sake. I don't want to be the way I used to. I just want to move on completely without embarrassing my self. Go as deep as you want (attachment theory, psychology, etc.) to explain my behavior.

Okay, so my girlfriend recently went back to work. Instead of working at an ice cream place, she's now working at a grocery store doing bagging. I've recently started bagging (first time job) at a local one, although not the same. She works almost 9 hour shifts, but my store works 4 hours. We work pretty much the same days, and get days off the same days. Now, I'm starting working - this is my first job - and so far, it's pretty sweet. I'm just bagging, along with restocking bags and cleaning occasionally, which all isn't that hard. She works pretty much the same thing, except does maybe a few other things, such as stocking or cleaning. We essentially do the same job but she has longer hours. Every day, since she's began though, every single time she has a break (whether it's an actual break or just her in the back room deciding to text me) she has to complain about something. She apparently works with a group of mental patients who apparently can't do anything - I've told her, time and time again, if it's REALLY that bad, talk to a higher-up, manager, supervisor, whatever. Apparently she has and apparently that same one has disciplined them. Yet, she still complains about them! Whether that's her problem or the supervisor's, I'm not sure. It's really starting to drag on me, having to respond to whiny texts when I'm trying to relax after working my first ever job. I understand she has more hours, but she has more experience - she should be used to this. I haven't complained once to her, but every day (I mean literally, every day) I get a complaint from her. I don't necessarily want to tell her ""listen, you need to stfu/htfu"" because she's really sensitive (we both are) but it's really dragging on me at this point. Help, please?

Throwaway and names changed for privacy. Roughly two months ago my wife up and left me out of no where. We had a brief discussion than where she explained that she was just very unhappy. Her explanation was that I was just not fulfilling her as a person, she had lost her identity, and she was feeling disrespected and unappreciated. After that she also explained that due to some physical altercations we had in the past she felt unable to continue our marriage and wanted a divorce. For clarity the physical stuff was a brief period in our relationship over 4 years ago, I attended extensive counseling and therapy, and have not act in such a manner since. Obviously this does not forgive the actions, but I've done everything possible to change the man I am. She quickly moved out after this, we split our assets, and have not really spoken since then, only short little conversations that were painful for me. I made every attempt to try to rectify the situation, suggest therapy, suggest temporary separation, whatever she needed to work on our issues and move through this together, but she wasn't hearing it. Now out of the blue she contacts me and tells me that she doesn't believe her options were as narrow as she once believed. She tells me she still loves and cares about me and is unsure of what she wants now. I'm completely lost though because I've spent the last 2 months trying to move on and pick up the pieces of my life. How do i determine if I'm willing to work on things with her, or if this breach of trust is just too much to get past? I still love her and care deeply for her, but this whole situation completely destroyed me. I'm finally start to regain some stability and happiness in my life, and the risk of inviting all of that potential pain back is terrifying. I truly do not believe divorce is ever a great option and never wanted to get one. Now I just don't know what's going to be the best for me. How do I make this decision?

I have been going out with a girl I'll call Katie for 2 years. We are starting to think about marriage but we agree that we do not want kids. I personally do not want to care for kids myself but I don't begrudge other people for having them. Katie is much more of the stereotypical ""childfree"" person and will ask if events are kid-free before attending, will ask to leave if there are kids in a restaurant, etc. My brother [33 M] has a young boy with his girlfriend [32 F] and they are getting married in the spring. Because they want to include their son in the service it's not a child-free wedding. When Katie and I got the invitation she noticed that there was no ""please don't bring kids"" disclaimer so she asked if it was a child-free wedding. I told her it wasn't and she stated pretty matter-of-factly that she would not attend. I told her that wasn't fair and that she should at least go for my sake because there is no way I won't go to my own brother's wedding. She said that she loved me and wanted to support me but that the ""really unfair thing is your brother expecting adults to attend a wedding with kids."" What should I do here? I could always go without her but I'd really prefer to go with her. I get that the wedding will not meet her preferences but I feel like she should at least consider going for my sake. I also think it would be obviously unfair for me to ask my brother to make the wedding child free because their plans to include their son are totally their own prerogative and other couples with kids may have already RSVP'd.

Hi, Internet Strangers, I've been with my current girlfriend for nearly two years now. I've very into science and technology while she is very arty. I don't really feel that we have so many common interests. It can be frustrating when I notice something in the world, and she just can't see it; for example she couldn't explain to me what caused the Coriolis effect. I don't think that she's stupid at all, we both go to Cambridge. She just seems to lack common sense about the natural world. She often feels that she is 'stupid' or 'unsuccessful'. On the other hand, we are excellent at keeping each other company and both love each other very dearly. She is kind, generous and funny. I can't help but feel that this is near the minimum of what makes a great partner. Most people can be kind and keep one from feeling lonely. I've recently been offered a dream job in another country for after my degree and I'm worried that if we end this now I won't be able to find another companion like her before leaving. I'm becoming very sad about this. We've spoken a little on the topic of shared interests, but I don't think that she knows the full extent of my feelings. We discussed trying new things together, and listed a number of things that we have in common. I don't know if any number of new things can make her more curious about the universe. Sorry if this was a little scatterbrained :/ Thanks, Internet Strangers.

I'll keep it as short as I can. I'm from the UK and she's in California. We met on [1] /r/BDSMpersonals and have been talking and ""playing"" for getting on for three months. She's coming to the UK as the first leg of a tour of Europe in early July and we agreed to take a few days to basically screw each other's brains out. Ultimately what I'm looking for is a long term relationship but I'm moving cities roughly at the same time she's coming here (phrasing, boom...) so I figured it would work out well. She's said before that she 's not looking for any kind of commitment and, after an incident where we had to redefine our relationship, we seemed to be OK. I made the cut into the people she actually decided to stick with. I'm starting to come round to the idea of her being polyamourous (I'm really not) but some of her choices of partner definitely freak me out. Fast forward to today and I get an email where she pretty much says that she's found exactly what she's looking for (roughly speaking it equates to a committed relationship) and wants to put things on hold between us sexually for as long as it takes her to get settled. She still wants to talk to me and still wants to see me in the summer but we can't ""play"" for this indeterminate period of time. Is there a way that this won't end up with me becoming her friendzoned friend who hears about all the people she's with (often in uncomfortable detail) based on a promise of sex in a few months based on a mutual attraction? I really like her and she really likes me but the more I learn about her life and the way she appears to treat people close to her, the more I wonder whether there's just no hope. Obviously you are only hearing my side and it's coloured by how I feel right now but I'd appreciate any advice you may have.

Throwaway, not that it really matters. We have been dating for a short time, but I really like her and enjoy spending time with her. Except when we're with my friends and/or coworkers. Whether it is big groups or just double dates, the minute we are around other people she starts asking stupid questions, pretending (at least I think so) like she doesn't understand something somewhat simple, or doing a weird ""oh I'm so useless at *cooking, driving, directions, etc.*!"" schtick. She is smart and funny, but she is very shy and not very talkative. She's the opposite of me, and she has only one close friend (whom she doesn't act like this around), but that doesn't bother me. I think she just gets anxiety or something, because she has mentioned before that she feels boring around other people/couples. Is this a coping thing? I mean, I am pretty sure it is, but should I say anything? It's kind of embarrassing since I know this isn't the real her, but do I wait and see if she gets over it? I want it to stop, but I have no interest in making her feel bad and become even more anxious/self-conscious.

I've known my now ex boyfriend for over 10 years (since high school). We used to be best friends, and then I got married, moved out of the country and we stopped talking because my husband at the time didn't like him, so my friend decided it was best to leave it alone since I was happy. I recently came back home when my dad got sick, and found out I was getting divorced. He was there for me, like the best friend he was, like nothing had ever changed. We started dating unexpectedly and were for about a year. I recently got accepted to another college, about 45 minutes away. I thought we should break up because I wasn't sure if I could handle a relationship with school and work and I was worried about not seeing each other and one of us cheating and everything else awful. We broke up, but it's still like we never broke up. Only a few people know, but we still spend the night with each other. We talk all day, everyday. Hang out, eat, play video games etc. I've tried just not talking and cutting all ties, but I love him and I can't. It literally hurts if we don't talk. I could honestly see myself marrying him with kids one day. I'm not one to be open about feelings, but he's the person I know I can count on, day or night no matter what. We technically broke up, but everything is the same, except we're friends, and I ask him to not call me ""honey"" or ""babe"" or be affectionate. I asked about friends with benefits, but it doesn't seem like it at all. I don't know if I should say yes we're back together, since it already seems it, or if I just need to keep it and slowly separate.

I'm a guy that was in love with his best friend. WAS is the key word here. There was a moment where I thought I wanted something more with her and I got all messed up in the head. It took me a few difficult days to realize it but I eventually came to the conclusion that I only wanted her in my life as a best friend that would get me through the hard times. My best friend is a girl who has real trouble accessing her feelings. She's had relationships that ended because of her emotional distance, and said distance sometimes makes her do things that aren't the greatest. She has a bit of a negative reputation and is planning on recreating herself when she moves away for college. The problem is, I'm the type of guy who is deeply in touch with his feelings. I'd labor for days over the right thing to say and am deeply aware when things are wrong. I care so much about my best friend, who hates herself for the things she's done and resents the fact that she doesn't care about me nearly as much. She feels guilty that I care so much about her, and often reminds me that she can't reciprocate any emotion. She keeps trying to push me away because of how much I care. She thinks all she'll do is hurt me and that I should give up on her. For me though, she is just misunderstood and confused, and if I leave like everyone else, I'm only reinforcing the negative attitude she has about herself. Right now, as hard as it is for me, I'm giving her space in order to figure herself out. We've done this before, but it always ends up with her pretending that everything is okay when I know things are not. I want things to go back the way they were before I pushed her away by admitting how much I care about her, but she does not want to talk about it any more. I'm afraid I'll have to pretend that everything between us is okay until the end of summer, and then she'll drop me for good and I'll never see her again.

Both male. Been together for a little over two months now, give or take. Maybe closer to three, depending on how you look at it. Anyway. He's at a party tonight with some friends. His description of said party was, ""Good music, entertaining ppl, and mind altering substances."" So far I'm aware of pot and pills taking place, and inevitably alcohol as well. Now, I don't have an issue with mind-altering substances in and of themselves. I smoke pot on occasion, I drink, and I will admit to maybe having taken a bit more than my dose of loritab when I had surgery a few months ago just to see what it was like. But I have had experiences with significant others getting fucked up and doing stupid things that ended up destroying my trust. He is aware of this fact. In light of that, I sent him a text saying, ""Just lemme hear from you on occasion, if you don't mind. And please, don't get super-fucked up and do something stupid. Not that I think you would, it's just that mind-altering substances are... well, mind-altering.""

Anyway we became friendly and after a while I thought he was interested in me but it turns out that he wasn't and just stuck to being friends. I had to move due to personal reasons and he offered me a place to stay with him (I also have a child). I pay him rent but it's a lot lower then what I should be paying, for the area and how nice his place is. He sticks to himself and never dates or anything (he is good looking and earns a lot so he wouldn't have trouble with it). Well he went out for work for a month and over the weekend I had a small party at our place. He has never said I couldn't have a party or anything but he kinda keeps to himself and that. The party got kinda out of hand and in the morning when I woke up I realised people got into his room and some of his stuff was missing. Now one of the things that is missing is a watch that his wife bought for him when they went on a trip. He has showed me it before and it's pretty much his prized possession. I don't know what to do here. Do I try and replace it and hope he doesn't notice? It was really personal to him. It was pretty much what he remembers his wife by and I'm pretty sure he's still not over her. I really don't want to tell him because it will absolutely crush him. What should I do?

I have been with my bf for about a year now, and most things are great except sometimes I find him inconsiderate / immature / ungrateful etc. Then he really shocked me one day when I said he should do something for his family because that's what you do for your loved ones, and he replied very decisively with a ""but I don't love them."" I guess it's understandable if his family is abusive / manipulative / took advantage of him and such, but that's not the case. I have met his family multiple times and they are fairly normal and nice people. He also calls his mother frequently when he has questions that older people tend to have the answer to, so it's not like they have a bad relationship. His family even supported him throughout college, with tuition, room and board, allowance and all, so he could graduate with no student loans whatsoever. When I pressed him on why he doesn't love his family he just said ""because they are very annoying and always complain about things that aren't my fault."" He claims that he only loves me, which is flattering to hear, but it also makes me very concerned. Now I'm starting to think that this is a huge red flag and maybe his personality flaws come from his seeming inability to love and appreciate people close to him. Am I over-thinking this?

...we're both married. Please hold the judgement and bashing. I know I was wrong, I'm not proud of it, and that's actually why we broke up. We both realized that while we love each other, what we're doing is completely fucked up. We decided to stop seeing each other and do the right thing, focus on our spouses. We parted ways on good terms but agreed that we should cut off all contact completely. How do I get over this? I'm looking forward to making things right with my wife and getting back to where we have been in the past. But I've got to go through the grieving process without any support. No one knew about the affair, and the only one who I could possibly talk to it about is the one who I absolutely cannot contact or else we'd fall back into the same pattern.

Please try and disregard the ages on this situation. So this girl really likes me, and I really liked her so I asked her out and she said yes. Now it's been about 2 months now and she seems...bored. I always make her feel special by buying her gifts, complimenting her, telling her I love her and that sort of thing. Recently, I was skyping her and my buddy called me and asked me if I wanted to join him for a game that was about 15 minutes away. I told my girlfriend over skype that I would have to leave and she got a little bad and hung up the call. Of course, I called her back and told her that I'm sorry that it was kinda last second, and that I hope she wouldn't mind. She didnt say anything and just hung up. I just texted her again and apologized. She has a tendency to get mad over small things really easily so I thought it would just blow over before the next day. Now she never smiles around me as much and she doesnt talk to me like we used to talk to each other. She just seems kinda bored now. I've tried talking to her about it and i've asked her if it was because of that night and she said it wasnt. But she's just been acting different around me. She's completely fine around her other friends. It's just with me.

I bought a house two years ago that has a hot tub. Shortly afterward I started dating someone and we recently got engaged. We are getting married in September. He moved in two weeks ago. I like my privacy. I like walking around naked after my shower and dancing in my undies in the kitchen while I make breakfast, and eating ice cream straight from the tub while I watch sad episodes on Netflix, and all kinds of other things I don't want my in-laws to walk in on. So, when my soon-to-be mother-in-law texted saying: ""Hi X, I tried calling earlier, wanted to use the hot tub. You should make us an extra key please. :) "" My response was: ""Sorry I missed your call, I was out to lunch! And I haven't been up for guests much lately, but you can always call and if it's a good time you're definitely welcome to come on over!"" She responded: ""I understand! But you seem very busy so it would probably be hard to find a good time. If you made us a key that way it wouldn't interfere with your schedule."" She then texted again a while later saying, ""If you don't have an extra copy handy, we can pick up [fiance's] key and make a copy of it so you don't have to go to any extra trouble! Let me know when I could stop by."" I thought about giving them a key with the requirement that they knock first, but in addition to liking my privacy when I'm already at home, I happen to like my privacy when I show up at home, as well. I want to be able to walk into my own space at the end of the day and not worry about unexpected guests. I really don't want to give them a key to show up whenever they want. Is there a way to tactfully shoot this down? My fiance is not available to jump in at the moment, so I'm on my own.

I really don't know where to begin here. My girlfriend and I both live with her parents in order to save money and pay off our student loans faster, but we both work and I think we do the whole adulting thing pretty well. My girlfriend is NOT a superstitious person. She does not believe in ghosts or anything paranormal and is a highly rational person about everything except this. A couple of weeks ago we were rooting around in the attic and we found her old Playstation 2 in a big box with all its games and accessories. Score. We set everything up and gamed the night away. It's important to note that there were three controllers, two that we used and a third one that was kept in a separate box that was taped shut. I asked her about it and she said ""We don't play with that one. It's cursed."" Apparently when she was a kid she noticed a pattern of friends and family members getting into car accidents shortly after she would play a game with the controller. After her uncle was in a fatal accident (he didn't die, but the driver of the other car did) she put away the controller for good. Like I said, my girlfriend is a very rational person who does not believe in anything supernatural. She even sounded like she was half-joking/embarrassed about it so I didn't think it was that serious. That weekend I invited a friend over to hang out and we decided to play some Playstation. Some buttons on one of the """"uncursed"""" controllers were sticking and making it hard to play, so I swapped it out with the """"cursed"""" controller and let my friend play with it instead. I honestly thought it was not a big deal and that my gf understood that the whole curse thing was just an irrational thing from her childhood. But she was actually kind of upset when she got home and saw it plugged in. She's boxed up the

My boyfriend is starting a new program at school and has been meeting many new people. Some of them are girls. He's always had more girl friends than guy friends, but it's important to note that these have been strictly platonic relationships. He's never been romantically involved with any of these girls he's been friends with for years. He's been talking (just casually) about some girls he's met, maybe a thing about them or something they said. The other day, he went over to one's apartment that she and her BF just rented. I guess she wanted to show him around/he's thinking of moving and was interested in the building. (At least that's what it seems like to me. He didn't give me a specific reason that he went over, and I didn't want to come off jealous by asking why.) After he told me this, I became very upset. I didn't tell him that, but I know he could see I was being weird. I couldn't eat dinner, I was being short with him. I am sure he didn't make the connection. But I'm struggling so much with this. He's never done anything to break my trust, ever. But other guys in the past have, and I think that's why I'm so upset by this whole thing. I've never met these ladies. I think I'll feel better if I meet them and they are cool/not hitting on my boyfriend. I'll probably be way worse if I feel like one of them has a crush on him. My boyfriend probably isn't going to put up with me being short with him for very long. I know it wears on him and he doesn't know why I'm doing it. But I don't think I can be honest with him.

Over the past 6 months, I've noticed our fights and unhappiness is coming more frequently. We both argue and constantly have to ask ""why are you mad?"" etc. I know these are normal things in a relationship but when is it too much? She's depressed now about her day-to-day job and our sex life is not as passionate as it used to be. She almost never wants to do it anymore, and everytime we do, it's a chore for her.

I'm afraid of the future, that is. We are both 18, in college, and have been dating for about 2 months. We haven't done anything that involves penetration or oral. (That mean's fingering as well) She's stroked me a bit, but there was no finishing. Now that that is out of the way, my main concern is that she is fairly prude. Whenever we do anything that involves us taking off our clothes, she want's the lights off. Furthermore, the one time I tried to finger her, she freaked out, stopped, and said she didn't want to risk it. I get the feeling she thinks she can get pregnant from finger. Neither of use have much sexual experience, but from what little experience I do have, I know what I'm doing. She thinks that gripping and squeezing on my junk is pleasurable. I would try and coach her, but I feel it's too early in the relationship to try and say anything; furthermore, she is fairly prude when it comes to talking about sexual things. She has stated that she does not like it when people say very raunchy things. At this point in the relationship, I'm not willing to push the limits for the sake of a handjob. Anyway, my main concern is that when we actually make it to sex, it will be plain and boring. I don't have any extreme fetishes or anything, just the basic doggy and blowjob. I'm certain she has never given a blowjob before, but from her sheltered background, I doubt she even knows what one is. Now I'm not basing the success of our relationship on if I ever get a blowjob or not, but I've quoted her saying, ""I could go my whole life without sex"" That scares me, because I can't. She assured me after saying that by saying, ""don't worry, I'll go all the way with you."" That's great, but I want us to enjoy a good sex life. I'm hoping her lack of sexual experience is what is creating this suggest lack of a sex drive.

I am now afraid to counter her on ANYTHING, in order to avoid conflict. The problem with this is that if she is doing something like working on the car or painting or fixing something or whatever, and she isn't going about it the best way, and I know a better method, but I just stand by and watch her do it wrong, when she finally sees that she's made a mistake, asks me what I would do, I tell her and she sees that it works, then it's MY fault that she messed it up because I didn't tell her how to do the thing, but if I HAD offered my suggestion from the beginning, she would have gotten mad.

Two weeks ago, my 21 yr boyfriend and I (20 yrs female) went through a really rough spot. We've been dating for 7 months, and I thought we were both really happy, but one morning I go to his apartment and found a note he had drunkenly written reminding himself to break up with me. Long story short, he said that he had been feeling too tied down and had been 'faking' the relationship for the past several weeks. We decided to take a break so he could think, since he said he still had feelings for me. The very next day, he ends up breaking up with me, but 4 hours later, at 2 in the morning, he calls me to say that he's at my back door. He tells me that he felt really terrible and that when he went home after the breakup, he saw reminders of me everywhere, and when he went for an hour long drive, all he could think about was missing me and how he wanted me back. So now, we're back together, but instead of spending time with him 4-5 days out of the week, its more like 1 or 2. He also promised to never lie to me about his feelings again. And I can live with the reduced contact, but I'm just so hurt from the two times he broke up with me that I feel like I can't talk to him about how I'm feeling anymore. I still want to be with him, but how can I get past the pain/betrayal? Please note that this is his first relationship.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year and half. We have been a long-distance couple for the entire time that we've been dating, but he was a very good friend I saw almost daily before we became a couple. I love him. He is an amazing person. No one in the world gets me the way he does or make me laugh like he does. He treats me better than I could have ever imagined possible, and I know without a shadow of a doubt that he loves me with all of his heart. We are starting to talk about moving in together in about a year, and while the idea excites me, it also makes me pause. Because as happy as he makes me, I'm not sure if he's ""the one."" I'm not entirely sure I believe in ""the one"" at all, but I can't help but wonder if committing permanently to him would make me miss out on something--or someone--else in the future. On the other hand, I fear that if I end our relationship because of my uncertainty to commit, it will be the biggest mistake of my life. To put it very bluntly I long for adventure and excitement, and my relationship has settled into...something ordinary and routine. In your experiences, does every relationship eventually become that? Or do many of you still experience butterflies and excitement in your relationship?

I say they all need therapy! I grew up in a household where we always had pets, I love animals. I cannot imagine a home without animals. Soon after me and my long term SO moved in together, we rescued 2 stray black cats. They are as nice as could be and are NOT asshole cats and are not aggressive (They do not hiss or swipe at people). I didn't even think this was a problem until we told my MIL, she freaked out. She claims that I got these cats to keep her away now. Even if I say I will lock them in a room so they can't get out (which I disagree with, I shouldn't have to do this to my cats, but I will comprise for her), she still won't come over. She even has said things like ""And of course you got BLACK cats!"", I didn't know she was superstitious? Weird. This is becoming such a strain. I refuse to get rid of my animals for her. She thinks I am being selfish because I know of her phobia and I still got cats anyways (honestly when we got the cats we didn't even THINK of my SO's Mom......like why does it have anything to do with her?).

We have been dating for nearly a year now, and I've felt myself getting over her for a while now (perhaps the last few months?). I feel as if that's largely due to me going through a period of a lot of stress and anxiety. The thing is we are extremely close and I know how insecure and attached she is to me. We're like bestfriends and have even been on multiple vacations together. I still love her and I would do anything for her but my romantic feelings aren't there and frankly it's killing me. I still think she's so amazingly gorgeorus too. We are both high school seniors and likely won't go down the same path down the road after gradation. Also, it's kind of ironic because before we started dating she broke my heart and said she has never had a boyfriend because of attachment issues and all, and it was one of the first times I cried over a girl. I kind of want to end things, but I am not sure how to approach that. Furthermore, hurting her would just be so awful.

So I have been dating this girl since January of this year. Its going super well. I've never had a relationship be this easy and wonderful. My best friend from back home called me earlier this week, and I felt super weird about it. I love the girl I'm dating, and so talking to another girl feels wrong. The fact that we have dated sporadically over the course of our friendship probably adds to that. She never really gave me a full shot in a relationship, which is part of the reason why I have moved away from home. I wanted to find myself, to stop being someones shadow hoping that things will change. And I'm happier than I've ever been. My girlfriend treats me better than my best friend ever did. My girlfriend knows I talk to her on the phone occasionally and seems cool with it, but I feel that if she knew the full extent of our long history she probably would be concerned about it. I think to give this relationship 100% and to be fair to my girlfriend I should tell my old best friend that I don't feel okay with us just chatting anymore. My two questions are, firstly, does this make sense? And secondly, if it does, how do I go about doing this? Can I say this in a text? Should I call? And what do I say?

I was born in and live in the US, raised by immigrant Pakistani-Muslim parents. Although I was raised Muslim, I don't believe in or follow the religion. For the past three years, I've lived away from home during the school year. During this time, I met my current boyfriend (white, non-religious). We have a great relationship, no serious issues, and we're definitely serious about each other. This year, my parents decided to move me back home so that I can get closer to my religion and ""learn how to be a good wife for my future husband"". Also, they've started looking for a husband for me and have no idea that my boyfriend exists. Yes, it's ridiculous. I don't know exactly how this will play out, but I generally need to get permission before leaving the house, usually can't sleep outside the house, can't stay out late, etc. We'll probably be able to see each other occasionally but all of this is obviously going to interfere with my relationship. My parents would not approve of my relationship and I'm pretty sure my dad would get violent if I admitted to having a boyfriend. I currently am not financially ready to move out and live on my own. (this will hopefully change after I graduate in spring 2016) Should I end my relationship so that my boyfriend can find someone who isn't so complicated? I feel so guilty that he has to be with someone who he has to jump through hoops to see. We do love each other a lot and he doesn't want to break up, but I'm afraid that staying with me isn't what will make him happiest. At the same time, I really need him, especially now while I'm dealing all of this stupidity at home. The thought of letting go of someone that gives me so much happiness and piece of mind seems impossible.

Let me start this by some background. He is not so well off like I could be considered and being in this field of studies he needed a new laptop so I offered him to sell my old one for 1/2 of what it's worth, to help him, etc. Mind that I, agains my better judgment, agreed to a ""flexible"" plan of payments (around $50 a month, until the agreed price is meet). Not 2 weeks pass and he is planning on buying a new laptop, while giving my old (the one he bought from me, or will in future) to his father to use for his job. I felt really unhappy because of it. I sold my laptop to him, for a low friends price, not to his father whom I have never met. And more so he is buying a new laptop that is worth a double of what we agreed on, and still is paying in pieces. Today I tried to lie my way out of this and told him that my mom needed that laptop and even offered him $100 for the troubles. I was ""pushed"" into saying ""oh wait I talked her out of this"" because he gave me this crap about ""now I won't have my new laptop that I was planning on buying""... All would be better if he payed me in total, then I could forget about this and move on.

My girlfriend and I had been together just a bit over a year. We are currently in a long distance relationship, but see each other pretty often thanks to my job that pay quite decently with lot of off time. She was supposed to move here 2015 summer after she finish college. Yesterday we were talking and she say that she may would have to stay another year or two to help her mom out with her two brothers (both high school age) and grandmother! I was upset about this! Her mom is more than capable of taking care of them but she simply doesn't want to be a mother any more! She have been trying to find someone to just dump them off at! My girlfriend somehow decided that she have to be like boys' second mother! I pretty much told her that this is not fair to me. She just keep making excuses after excuses about everything then try to say we'll find a way to make it work! Is this appropriate or fair?

It should probably be noted that I havent had a relationship in nearly 4 years. Due to the fact that I'm a college student I haven't had all that much time to dedicate to anyone (maybe that's just an excuse, but regardless) Anyway, I recently met this girl that I immediately clicked with. My recent trend throughout the college years has been mostly casual hookups and very very light dating, but with her things have been different. We've been out in public together, we've held hands and kissed in public, she's spent the night multiple times where we have just fallen asleep, spooning one another, and even dates have happened - god I haven't taken a girl on an actual date in years so this feels huge. I find myself constantly wanting to talk to her and hang out with her, and it feels so weird because I'm not usually like this to that extent. It's still pretty recent, all of this, so I know I can't really say with full confidence that it means anything, and maybe it's just a lack of confidence in the situation, but I wonder if this is as real as I think it is. Is she into me the same way I'm into her? How do I progress what we are doing into something more serious? When is the right time to? I'm actually quite interested in committing to something for once, and I want it to work out.

This is a really strange problem, I know. I'm a pretty big Taylor Swift fan. She's a nice persons, she makes good music, she's pretty, and I like her sense of style. I have all of her albums, and recently I got to go to one of her concerts! My older brother got me tickets. I don't bring Taylor Swift up in everyday conversations because I know not everyone likes her. And I'm cool with that! I don't like one direction, and there's nothing wrong with that. But whenever I mention her, my dad gets really mean. My mom was showing me her Instagram because I don't have one and was curious. She had really cute pictures of her and Calvin Harris up. I went ""I hope one day I can find a guy that nice! Good for Taylor!"" And my dad just went off. I can't remember exactly what he said, but it was along these lines, ""Why would you want to be like her? She's a slutty girl who can't sing! You better not be like her!"" He does this EVERYTIME I mention her. My sister had to drive me to her concert because he wouldn't stop being mean. I just want him to stop! Thank you in advance for any advice.

I met my Bf online. He is in Ireland and I am in the US. We have plans to meet when I study abroad in the UK I love him so much, and he loves me. There are no red flags in this relationship, except that he hasn't talked to me in a while. Id rather not my family know of our relationship until I see him, so at home we use Kik and Facebook to talk and Skype when I am in Uni. I have had times when he didnt talk to me for a few days, but he is poor so he cant afford a non glitchy phone. We haven't had a proper conversation since the 4th of july, and the last time he responded to me was 10 days ago. He has made the excuses that ""he isn't online much"" despite it being the only way we can communicate. Its confusing to me because on kik and Facebook my messages were delivered, but he hasn't read them (despite being online Facebook recently). I try to understand that he cant be online all the time, but at least some communication would be nice. I am at my wits end with this. I am not sure if I should break up with him.

I'm 23F, and my training manager (not my boss) is 35M, married with a son. I know he finds me attractive because he's told me I looked ""stunning"" and ""smoking hot"" at a business dinner and the body language isn't all that subtle sometimes. However, it's always been pretty innocent. Last week was my last day working under him, so he took me out to a rather expensive sushi lunch on what I assumed was company money (not uncommon). Come to find out it was actually on his dime. The lunch sort of felt like a weird date. He was asking me questions about my life and interests, and even blushed a bit while I was talking to him, which I'd never seen him do before. He did however mention his family a little, so as to not come off as weird I guess. However, he asked me if I was ""sheltered"" when I was growing up, to which I said no and asked why he was asking, but he said ""no reason"". That was the second time he asked me that though, so I thought it was odd. Back at work, when we were both clocking out, he waited for me by his car and told me I should come get drinks with him and everyone the following week. Even though I've always had a crush on him, I still consider him a mentor at work and would like to maintain the relationship because I go to him for advice since he's so good at what he does. Do you think this sounds like something I need to be concerned about, or am I over-analyzing it?

I am at my wits end. My fiance, who I love dearly, has a crack in a cap on his front tooth. In the creases of the crack it's brown, so basically it looks like he has a rotting tooth or something!

I feel guilty about my embarrassment because I love him anyway but we are not destitute, we can afford to have it fixed! I have been asking him for months now to make a dentist appointment and he gives me attitude about it and just doesn't do it. I'm thinking I should start doing something really unattractive to myself until it bothers him....half joking, half not... What do you think? Should I do something to make myself less attractive and if so, do you have any clever ideas? If I should take a more mature approach, what should I do here?

Hi Reddit. My ex boyfriend is not a good man. We dated for about eight months before I discovered that he was married, to a woman in another state who he didn't really know. Military, they married for the extra money. They do not talk, or associate in any way. But, I didn't want to be involved in the shit storm, so I broke up with him. Since then, I have tried to remain civil with him, as I would love to give him another chance when he settles his issues. He had agreed to take some time apart from me to handle his issues, namely the marriage. Since leaving him, it has been a complete and total shit storm. He lies to me, changes his story, and has gotten mildly involved with other girls, which also bothers me, because he is putting them in the same position I was put in; getting involved with someone who is married. He does a lot of things that are right on the line of being acceptable. When I call him on them, he will try to justify it, telling me I'm just being paranoid or that I was looking too far into things. He will try to blame things on me, or absolve himself of responsibility for being married, etc. Sometimes, he makes me think that it will be okay. He'll buy me flowers, surprise me with dinners, swear up and down that he loves me and wants to fix it, etc. Usually after he gets caught. Go figure. Overall, I'm fully aware it isn't a good relationship, and that this isn't healthy. For whatever reason, I'm having a really hard time leaving, and staying away. He is not a person that needs to be in my life, I know, but I keep going back. I'm worried that I will fall into a pattern of manipulation and mental abuse.

Okay, I have done a bit of online dating and have had good results (3 more than a year relationships, 2 proposals.) The problem is I never meet anyone I am REALLY into, they are all great guys, but they just don't do it for me. I finally caved and signed up for EHarmony. Mostly everyone is ""meh."" But this one guy contacted me, and I am like, yep, you are awesome. I sent him back the next automated step (EH is totally lame set up of forced communication) and he never wrote back (The first step is totally generic so it is not like I gave new info he would not be into). Of course he is the ONLY guy who stopped communication while I'm getting nudges from everyone else and their dads. Here is the question: Do I reach out and contact him? (On EH this would require me sending him an email that is accompanied by: ""This user would like to skip recommended steps in our process, do you agree to waving...."") Two trains of thought: 1. Of course! Why shouldn't girls reach out. What do you have to lose? He may have just gotten busy matching socks at home. 2. Uh, he's not that into you. He is obviously on a dating site, contacting people, so it is not that he is being shy. He logs in regularly. If was interested, he would reply. And if I do break my internal rules, what could I possibly say? ""Hey, I noticed that you haven't replied for 3 weeks. I think you are making a grave error.""

So here's a little background. I've been with my girlfriend for six years. We met in high-school while I was a senior and her a freshman. I love her but I don't want to spend the rest of my life with her, and telling her something like that would break her heart. We don't have nearly as much in common now as we did six years ago, or even two years ago, and I just don't feel the ""magic"" anymore. I've been feeling this way for about a year now, and I haven't changed anything because I'm afraid and don't want to devastate her. We haven't been intimate for about a month now, and she keeps asking if anything is wrong, but I say no every time because I'm a coward. Over the last few months I've grown more distant, and I've started to slip into a mild case of depression. I know that I don't want to be with her any more, but I still respect and love her. I understand that there will be pain in any scenario like this, but I can't think of a good way to end things without just destroying her.

Hey guys, I just need a second opinion on what's going on here. So there's a girl that is a friend of a friend and we met at new years which was at my own house. My friend invited her, and throughout the night her and I really hit it off. I got her number, and Snapchat, but my parents were around so that was all that happened. Since then her and I have hung out a few times, I took her to a movie once, and she also came over to my house once. I see her quite often as well because our friend group has been hanging out together a lot lately. When we hang out just her and I, she'll let me put my arm around her or whatever and get close to her, and we kiss. But whenever we're with our friend group she seems really hesitant, and none of the above happens, and it bothers me. I asked her if it was because she doesn't have feelings for me, and she says ""I don't know exactly how I feel and it's difficult for me to tell."" But after one incident of us being around the friend group and her being hesitant I stopped texting her so often. I used to always text first, but now that I stopped doing that she's texting me first. So why is it that she tells me ""She doesn't know how she feels"" but she still tries to talk to me, without giving me a serious answer? I'm trying to take this to the next level and it seems like she doesn't care. Lately she's been ""busy"" too, which means we haven't been able to find time to do anything. She knows that I'm really interested in her, and I don't know if she's just leading me on or if she's actually interested in me, but when I ask all I get is ""I don't know"". Is she interested, or not? How do I get a clear, concise answer?

It may have broken down his emotional wall but it didnt break down his ""I dont want to open up"" wall.

Hello /r/relationships! As the title implies, I have been wondering what a romantic relationship actually is. I so far haven't had any mutual relationships (or any non-mutual ones that I know of), of this kind. This means my assumptions are mostly based on fiction, second hand information and common sense. I have experienced attraction and I guess I have experienced what most people would call a ""crush"" to some extent. Romantic love to me is a very fuzzy concept. From what I understand it is not simply attraction and also ""more"" then a ""crush"". Recently I have been wondering if I might have experienced romantic love without actually noticing it as such or putting that label on it. While what I suspect might have been romantic love doesn't really satisfy the implications of fiction/second hand experience on this topic, the pattern in which I have experienced it leads me to find it reasonably likely to be exactly that. I would describe it as a desire to be known and to know the other individual completely, combined with over average caring about their wellbeing and experiencing the presence of the other as unusually pleasant. It's not tied to any desire for sexual/romantic behavior, while physical contact, as in hugs and simple touches, is experienced as pleasant. Now, all these things are to some degree part of any normal friendship to me, and considering how everybody is making such a huge fuss about romance, I would expect a more distinct difference. Usually I wouldn't care and just ignore the topic until things develop naturally, but there is a reasonable chance I will be moving in with someone I might have romantic feelings towards who is currently in a relationship with someone else and while I would really enjoy this persons company, I would like to avoid the potential drama/feeling-like-shit due to unreciprocated love I am lead to expect due to the knowledge available to me in case I actually do have these feelings.

Hello reddit! So here's the situation: me and my boyfriend have been together for about one year. After graduating from college in May, I ended up in an apartment with a flexible lease (can end it with 60 days notice at any point throughout the year) in an apartment about 5 minutes away from my boyfriend's house. I have one roommate, a guy that graduated a couple years before me from the same school but wasn't someone I knew previously, and his dog, who barks every time I enter the apartment and I'm generally not crazy about. I've ended up spending 99% of my time at my boyfriend's place and sleep there every night, basically using the apartment as a large closet where I go to pick up or drop off my stuff sometimes. My boyfriend and I are very compatible and have had minimal issues ""living together"" as we have been the past few months. Only problem that could be more of an issue in the future is that he isn't the type to go out to bars or stay out late and I like to do that occasionally, but there's a bed in his basement and we've discussed that I could sleep there if I happen to be getting home way past his bedtime. It seems like it would make sense for me to just move in with my boyfriend officially at this point and stop wasting money on the other apartment, but I know that one year isn't a very long time to have been together before making a big decision like that, especially since I'm so young. To add to that, my parents have told me that they would **not** be comfortable with me living with him and not having a backup situation in case something went wrong. I don't want to jump into this without thinking it through, but the current situation is stressing me out a lot and I'm ready for some sort of change. My boyfriend also thinks that I should move in with him (and is generally pushing it more than I am), but my parents still help me out financially and are very important to me, so I don't want to ignore their advice. Let me know what you think!

So, I've been seeing such a cool girl this past month. We've had sex twice and have seen each other a few times a week. She's pretty introverted, works for a really popular venue and is sought after by so many guys. The thing is, we seem to have so much fun when we're around one another but I continually am getting this vibe that I'm hanging from a thread and that she doesn't like me the way I like her. I texted her two days ago to hang out, she doesn't respond. In frustration I texted her today to ask her how she feels about me because I don't want to keep having feelings for someone who doesn't value me. I actually told her I liked her about a week ago and she said she ""liked hanging out with me"", she also told me she may be moving in 8 months and she doesn't know if she wants to get attached. I thought that was her way of letting me down nicely but then we had sex the next day. Anyway, after I texted her tonight, she asked if I'd like to meet up tomorrow evening. I suggested a cocktail place since she'd be free later at night. Idk what to think about it but I feel a lot of good things for her. Is she most likely gonna let me go tomorrow? Is there any point in trying to convince her that moving away in 8 months isn't a big deal and to try to convince her to like me?

Forgive me if this is a little incoherent, I'm really shaken up right now. So last night I went to my friend's 21st birthday party. Naturally, many drinks were had by all. I usually am a really responsible drinker, but I went a bit overboard this time, I'll admit. I know it was really irresponsible to drink so much, but I was in the company of friends and people I trusted. Long story short, I fell asleep next to someone I'd met that night. Again, irresponsible move, but I just needed to crash and that's how it turned out. At some point, I woke up and remember being cuddled and sort of groped (my breasts and butt/genitals) by the guy i'd fallen asleep with. At this point I was extremely incoherent and I didn't really understand what was happening. I don't think I was really able to tell him to stop, but I definitely tried shaking him off and moving away multiple times. Eventually he stopped, apologized, and I guess I fell back asleep. In the morning, I was sort of unsure of what happened. I don't really think it was his fault, because we were both really drunk. But I felt really disgusted and dirty and went home crying. I realize that it is partially my fault for getting drunk but I feel like this was really unsolicited and it's definitely not something I'd ever want to do. Anyways, after I slept and worked up the courage, I decided to tell my boyfriend. He reacted in ways that I never expected. He's really mad at me and basically said ""what did you expect? You should know the consequences of getting drunk."" I think he feels like I cheated on him, but I don't feel the same. I know that getting so drunk is a bad idea, but I don't know who is in the right here. I feel like I made some shitty choices, but ultimately I also feel like he's trying to victim blame me for it, and that is really upsetting and disturbing. At the same time, maybe it is my fault for not being able to say no with my words. I don't know what to do.

I start the job and I get home from the first day of training and we start talking about random stuff, after a bit I give her a few kisses, not necessarily to start anything but mostly to test the waters. She breaks down and says she still feels nonsexual and wants to talk about some other stuff.

So I'm 22, not very experienced in relationships really, been single since I was 18 and haven't really attempted proper dating until recently. Anyway, I meet this girl through OKcupid and we've been on 8 dates since the end of January and things have been going good, we've have kissed at the end of most dates and I've really started to like her. We've typically texted everyday since we've met, on our last date we hung out at mine house, cuddled and kissed at the end of the evening, and I set up the next time we should hang out (her day off). I texted the next day, just a casual, ""Hey, hows it going?"" text, she never got back that day, or the next day, or today up to this point, it's not unusual for her to take her time to text back, we both take our time but it's never been this long, usually only a few hours or next morning. I've started to over think that I've possibly done something wrong that I'm not aware of or she realised she's not that into me. I never realised how paranoid I've got about it until today, maybe it's just because we met on a dating site and that she could have easily have found something else. The more I write the more this sounds ridiculous, but I'm stumped, really what I'm looking for is the next course of action, should I wait it out or text her again, if so what should I say?

I really need some advice here. I met Spencer during the summer on an internet dating website. I had just recently broken up with my ex and kinda wanted to just have fun. Spencer and I started talking on the dating site until eventually we made plans to hang out and have sex. I always have had a thing for older guys, I'm not sure why. When we met up we ended up going to dinner first to get to know each other a bit. We ended up really enjoying ourselves and spent over two hours at dinner. Afterwards we head to his house and have some fun. Since then we started hanging out all the time and texting non-stop. We really enjoyed each others company. I started to meet some of his friends, so naturally I introduced him to two of my best friends. Things went great. The problem is now that we are starting to become more long term, I am scared of our age difference. I am scared how I will be judged by society, by my family, and by some of my friends. It is really hard for me because I sincerely like him and he likes me too. This weekend, while we were cuddling, I brought up the topic. I eventually told him, as time passes, my fears are not diminishing and I still don't feel comfortable to ever introduce him to my family. Basically stating that this wasn't a real relationship. He ended up crying and telling me he thought I was the ""one"" for him. Since then we both have kinda of given each other time to process everything. I am very confused now. I don't know what to do. I really like him, and see that we have a lot of chemistry together. But the age difference makes it so hard, and taboo. So my question is pretty much: if the relationship is working and making me happy, do you think I should throw it away because of fear of judgement from society about age difference?

So I have a casual relationship with M/23 since November. We haven't really had the exclusive talk yet and I know he wants to get more serious. Anyway, I met this other guy through a game. We started hanging out a lot since January. I'd stay over at his house and we'd have a lot of sex. But we were only friends, maybe a little more than friends but not dating. I was even thinking of breaking it off with M/23 for this guy. Anyway, last week M/27 broke it off with me. His life is getting hectic and he needs to get it under control. He's gotten more responsibility at his job, his life is going out of control, etc. I'm devastated. The guy used to say we were going to take trips together, hinted that he would eventually ask me to move in with him, the whole shebang. I was starting to envision a life with him. Now even when I hang out with M/23, I'm still unhappy and all I can think about is M/27. We're still trying to remain friends and everything but it's really hard to talk to him. He won't budge on his decision (I got weak and asked if there was anything I could do to change his mind). How do I get over him?

I've been with my partner for 4 years, he is the only person who has not emotionally abused or manipulated me in some way. Although I know he cares about me and loves me, he is quite a lazy person, he doesn't put much effort into the relationship or his life in general. He has failed his classes and is in lots of debt. I've tried to ignore this but I also don't feel like a priority in his life, and just seem to be something that's there when he's bored. I've tried talking to him before, I've told him I'm very lonely and I feel like I don't have a partner most of the time (I don't see him often, usually for a weekend every two weeks), but he's made no effort to change and it's gotten to the point now where we are so distant that I no longer love him or feel emotionally connected to him at all. Despite this I feel incredibly guilty, he's the only person who has ever been caring towards me and I know if I needed him he'd help me with anything (If I specifically told him I needed help, but still). I don't know how to deal with the break-up, I know he's going to cry and try to get me to stay, I'm not a strong person. Also because of the long-distance, it's either going to end up with me stuck at his house, or him stuck at mine, and I know that I should go to his, but he is insisting on coming to mine this weekend, and I don't want to put him in the position where he has to make a long journey back in a state after he's travelled all the way to see me. I really need some advice; what's the best way to break it to him? And is there anything I shouldn't do in specific? Thanks in advance.

I broke up with her about a week ago and I have been feeling better each day, but I still will break down when I think about her. She lived far away so I wouldn't get to see her often. I broke up with her because I felt bored with our relationship. Whenever she visited acted like it was no big deal and we wouldn't talk that much when we were away from each other. I also started having trouble telling her that i loved her. It used to be so different for the first 2 years of our relationship, but then I think the distance started making it tough for me. She always showed that she loved me so much and I had trouble showing it back. Well now I can't stop thinking about her and I feel like I love her so much more than before. I want to ask her to take me back because I know I will be a better boyfriend and tell her I love her and do everything that i should have done. I think this will make our relationship better and we can stay together. I just don't know if that is true. It's impossible to really tell what will happen if we get back together. I want her back, but I don't want to hurt her again if I fall out of love down the road. If I ask her to take me back will it be better now that I know what it's like without her? Or will it eventually go back to me getting bored and breaking up again? I feel completely different than I did 1 week ago.

We have been dating for roughly 3 months and I can honestly say it is the most satisfying relationship I have had in such a short time. Maybe it's because we both realize that we are at that point in our lives where we know what we want and we share those things with each other. I have shared things with her I have never told anyone, as I want her to be a part of my life. I suffer from Frontal lobe traumatic brain injury and was up front with her about it. Because of this damage, I can at times become irritable, mean, rude and just plain pissy. I try and control it as well as I can, but it is hard. I try not to be negative towards people, but sometimes it just flows. This is what she can't stand. She understand that it's hard for me, but I don't think she comprehends how difficult it actually is. So when she points out how I'm being rude or difficult, I get defensive. This in turn causes a small argument. I hate that we fight and I don't want to. It just feels that she is attacking me. I know she is not, but I remind myself that after it is too late. I don't want to lose this woman. She is great. She makes me happy. I want to simply return her kindness and caring and honestly don't know how.

I've been getting to know this girl a bit and she's got one ugly past man. Like her and I are completely different people when it comes to that sense. We're both seniors in High School and she's slept with 8 different guys since June 4th, 2014. (she told me when she first lost her virginity). 4 being relationships and other 4 being just for fun/her being heartbroken. She use to party, and she use to blackmail people because she use to get picked on and had to stand up for herself and not get pushed around. I'm still a virgin and I don't party 'much'. Not on the same level as her. I'm on good terms with pretty much everyone. Anyways, she use to do all this so it's the past of course, but it's always in the back of my head. How do I get over her past? Also, people have given me shit for being around this girl cause she's not exactly on good terms with everyone and this girl is one of those girls you really have to get to know and crack open to find out who she truly is. you know? So how do I get over that? How does a guy on good terms with everyone talk/see a girl that isn't on good terms with everyone and a lot of people don't like her?

I'm going to be home over the holidays starting tomorrow and will have to deal with my dad's girlfriend who I find very difficult to be around. She and my father have been dating for 6 months and he seems happy, despite everything. I would never interfere with their relationship, and though I would prefer he dated someone else, I know that's not in my control. But I need help surviving the holidays with her. She is critical of me (""why did you choose this nail polish color? its such an old lady color""/""you need to smile more in pictures, this ISNT working for you""), super racist (legitimately thinks that all muslims need to be ""eliminated,"" loves Donald Trump) and has even done stuff like thrown away my makeup and shower gels without asking. (She said they were ""too old"" which they totally weren't, but even if they WERE she should have asked me). She also smacked my dads butt while making eye contact with me. HOW am I supposed to react to that sh*t?? Thankfully I'll be over at my mom's house for the most part. How do I firmly but kindly reject her comments and advice? She says stuff like ""honey, don't you want to change before going to the restaurant?"" when I'm wearing something perfectly nice and presentable. Also any tips on minimizing my time over there/escaping their guilt tactics (""ohhh we wanted to see you more!"") would be great.

My bf and I have been dating for 5 months, I'm in college and about 1.5 years away from getting my degree, he has a stable, decent paying job and bought a house a couple months ago that he is almost finished working on; by the end of the month he should be moved in (out of his mother's house) with 2 of his friends. We live about 25-30 min away from eachother, but while I'm at school it's closer to an hour apart. Our relationship has been good, there have been some little bumps along the way, but nothing too serious or red flag worthy. Last night, however, we had a conversation that has left me feeling... well, not too happy. Basically, he told me that he's worried he might ""change"" once he moves out on his own. He has never lived away from home, and he says he doesn't know if he'll want to experience things single once he's out of the house. I equated it to how people break up with their high school bf/gf before going to college, and he said that was a pretty accurate analogy. I could understand it, I guess... but he isn't going to college, it's not like he's suddenly going to be around thousands of new people. It wasn't just that, he said he could also see himself marrying me and being with me forever (I feel the same way about him, though neither of us mean in the near future) but he doesn't know which way his mind is going to go once he moves out. I don't really know if I'm explaining this well... he overthinks things, and also said that this is a lot of overthinking. I told him how I felt about it all last night, but there was nothing that really felt like closure. I just don't know what to do now, or how to conduct myself. It makes me feel kind of like I'm suspended, waiting for some ""turning point"" with him. I feel like I have to impress him into keeping me around or something.

I am 20, been in too many relationships to count. I'm done, It's exhausting. I just want one. I felt like I couldn't settle until I ran into the first genuine person in my life, kind and giving not wanting things in return. It kind of irked me and now I feel I had every reason to be weary. What once was a fantasy of him wanting to date a dancer he hit it off so well with quickly turned to guilt on his part. He said he felt like he was taking advantage of me, I felt vice versa. He wants someone to grow old with. I want someone to settle down with. Yet instead of seeing comparable similarities he turns me into a charity case, Helps me and gets the warm feeling of a kind donation for a girl down on her luck. Me? I just want him. I don't want bits and pieces of good, I want its whole source. He was drawing away so I finally told him how I felt. Infatuated. Me, infatuated. 39M... Well, he's happy to be there and see me 'grow' Is this healthy? He has done nothing but help but I am enraged, so angry, so sad. I guess he taught me how to settle down but not with a significant other. I'm crushed, he made me want to do so much right. Even if he still can... one day when Ms. Right does come around, I'll have to leave the picture. A twenty year old stripper friend would just be so unsightly to his future companion. Hethinks I'll be on before him, I think he's wrong. Even If I may look it I knew I would have functioned better in his company. Not to mention I get the nagging feeling that all of this relationship changing isn't just because It makes him feel right but because friends and family would never accept a decision from him to be with a girl like me. Just shattered.

My girlfriend of 7 month broke up with me last week. I'm slowly getting over it, and used too the thoughts of her not being in my life anymore, even tho it still hurts. The one thing that is driving me crazy is the fact that she doesn't know why she lost her romantic feelings for me. She said i was the best boyfriend, i was an amazing person, attractive and none had treated her like this. She had a really good time when we were doing things. She really wanted it to be us in the future, but her feelings wasn't there anymore. And she don't know why herself. She was obviously very frustrated and sad about this. She said all this during and after the breakup. Now, she's over me/us, and only sees me as a friend. And i'm struggling to get closure because i'm just lost. I'm lost because i really don't know what i did wrong or what i could'v done different. I don't know what i can improve on. Is this a common thing? Can a girl just lose her feelings without knowing the reason, even tho she has a really good time with me, and thinks i'm still attractive? Anyone with a similar experience?

Been together for a year and 2 months, we've known each other for about 3 years before that. Basically I have decided to go away for a month to take up an important (in my eyes) work contract that will benefit me eventually once I finish school than if I work closer to home for a month (I worked there this past summer as well). He will be in school while I'm gone and when I do come back I start school again too. So I tell him before I say yes to the contract and ask how he feels about it. He tells me to do what I please. So I say yes seeing as it's something I'll enjoy. Now that I've said yes he tells me I'm being selfish and not thinking of him. He also tells me we'll no longer be able to talk via Skype since our schedules won't coincide (I work evenings and finish at 10 while he goes to school during the day) or text since my phone has no signal. I know he ends up staying up until 1 in the morning some week nights to talk and play games online with his friends. I have told him I'll buy a prepaid cell phone to be able to use while there. Now my question is as follows: am I being ridiculous for thinking that he could easily make a sacrifice for a couple game nights to talk to me? Am I being selfish or is he? I don't want to get angry about all this but it is a reoccurring problem for me and I know he's trying to be more understanding but sometimes he doesn't quite see how much he gives to his friends while I sit patiently in the background.

I'll start this by giving a brief history of our relationship. This was the first major relationship for both of us. We were eachother's first for everything, from kissing to losing our virginities to each other. We have been together since our sophomore year of highschool, and are now both at college, 5 1/2 hours away from eachother. Over the summer, we hit a really rough patch. I had been having doubts about our relationship for a few weeks, and when I brought them up to her, it spiraled out of control and we almost ended the relationship. Most of my doubts centered around my worries that we weren't right for eachother. We have little in common, and it seems like a lot of the time she tolerates things I do or like rather than enjoy them. However, things got better and we went into this year feeling fairly confident about our status. But now that I'm away, the old doubts are returning and I can't shake them. I graduated in a class of 56 kids and am now in a major university with over 25,000 students. Being here has kind of opened my eyes in a lot of ways. Honestly, I just don't see a future in our relationship anymore. I sat down the other day and wrote a list of all the qualities I would want in a potential SO, and while my girlfriend is a great person, she doesn't really show almost any of those qualities. Basically, intellectually, I feel like breaking up is the right move. Even if I was sure about us, the distance would be a huge struggle. But the thing is, whenever I think about what I would have to say, I don't know if I can do it. It hurts to think about breaking up with this girl I have share so much with and been through so much together with. So my question is - is this normal? If anyone has been through a similar situation, or wants to offer any advice at all I would appreciate feedback.

OK so some background: we've been together 10 years, married for 5. 3 kids together. I'll try to make this quick. Basically my husband watches videos (documentaries, interviews) about a certain topic often. We were discussing it today and I said I don't personally enjoy ___ but I know you enjoy learning about ____.... He cut me off and said ""no you're wrong, I have no emotional connection to it at all"". Now, this would be OK if it were true. But he has expressed over and over his enjoyment with said interest. Also, he occupies his time with information about it, frequently. So to me it was obvious observation. Hell, he has even *said* he enjoys learning about it. This is a very simple, stupid thing. I don't understand why he would argue against liking something he so easily expressed interest in before, for years. I guess I am looking for some insight as to why he would behave as if I did something wrong for saying something he himself has said before...? This is not the first time things like this have happened. It seems he says things one day and says the opposite another day. Then swears up and down he never said anything different. I just don't get it. I feel like I'm going crazy. Insight, advice, tell me I'm crazy... Anything you got, I'll listen.

FUCK MY LIFE ABSOLUTELY RAGING RIGHT NOW, I TREATED THIS GIRL LIKE ABSOLUTE SHIT BECAUSE ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS GET MY DICK WET BUT NOW GETTING COMEUPPETS /rant over So backstory to this, my girlfriend lets call her Gabrielle and I had previously had a serious relationship for approximately 1 and a bit years. This is where things started to fall apart with being on and off again. Fast forward to now. It all started where Michelle and I were getting into the groove of things again after a shaky break up. During this period of time we hadnt put a name on our relationship so we decided to call it a ""thing"" that wasn't too serious but had the intent of evolving into a relationship eventually. So when we get back into this ""thing"" I was going to parties and gatherings majority of the time where Michelle wasn't really my first priority and only saw her once or twice during this period. I didnt really care if she was there or not so I kind of neglected her during that time. Mean while she's there trying her absolute hardest to get my attention. At these parties I would generally make out with one or two girls. In total it wad around 7 throughout the course of the few weeks. Fast forward to more recent weeks where I began to gain feelings for her and stopped heading out every weekend and making moves on women. I start to want to hang out with her as much as she did during that time where I was neglecting her and this results us to where we are now. In short, due to my borderline personality disorder I did some things that made her lose feelings for me combined with the fact that she has barely any time to hang out because of work so that just makes it even harder to get a hold of her while I'm here back with full feelings. She claims she's confused and doesnt know what she wants. It's just so hard for me to let go. Ive tried and tried but it just doesnt work. The love I have for this girl is imense and I just don't know what I would do without her.

My boyfriend and I were together for a little over a year and a half. About a year in, I started to see warning signs that this wasn't the kind of relationship I wanted. He was drinking heavily every night, often lying to me about it, or concealing from me that he was drunk and high. He did several things while drunk that were upsetting - crashing into my neighbor's car, picking me up drunk when I needed a ride and lying about whether he'd been drinking, confessing later that he knew he'd been too drunk to drive. He was emotionally disconnected from me, the sex went from very frequent to 1-2 times a month, and every effort I made to gently, kindly address the situation left him feeling attacked and abandoned. I tried to fix it, and he was not a willing participant in fixing it - it was like I was betraying him by pointing out that it was breaking, and then that it was broken. Finally it was too much, and I broke up with him. I am pretty certain that it was the right thing to do. But I still miss him so badly. We thought we were going to be together forever. I feel too guilty to go online to try and date, for fear that he will see my profile and feel betrayed. I have had the opportunity to flirt with other people, and I just can't, I feel like I would be betraying him. I still love him. I still miss him. He says he still loves me. I have only seen him once since we broke up. I don't know what to do, or how to start to heal.

OK, it's a short story. I've [24M] been with my significant other [24F] for a little more than five months and, to be honest, I think the whole sordid affair has run its course. She's a perfectly nice person but we're just not that compatible, we're both busy so we don't see each other that often (and, when we do, it's me showing up at her place at 10PM and leaving at 7AM), and our sex drives are totally on different levels (mine a lot higher than hers). I guess one can never be sure but I believe the right thing to do is breakup. To be clear, I have tried talking to her about some of the things that bother me -- we can't do much about our schedules, that's just how life/work goes; she's not a super passionate or energetic person so there's no hope of getting her to be enthusiastic to do much more than sit on the couch and watch TV; and I brought up the amount of sex we have (it's 2 times a week, maximum, and it's almost always at my initiation. We would absolutely have less sex if I didn't push the subject), but no change there either. It's making me irritable and we're getting into fights. There's really no point to that for either of us. We both deserve to be happy and that doesn't work when I really don't enjoy the prospect of being around her anymore. Which sucks because she really is a good person. She'll be a fantastic girlfriend for someone, just not for me. Here's the wrinkle: She's a grad student entering three weeks of finals and she's been pretty crushed with work. I am wondering what's the best option: (1) try to generally avoid her and then breakup in early January so that she can get through December without the added stress of a breakup OR (2) break up immediately, thus no prolonging this any further.

Ok, so I have posted about this before. My girlfriend and I split after she told me she was unhappy. Come to find out she had been talking to another guy for about a month before hand and kissed him at her sisters wedding. She had been telling me that we could try again down the road but after finding that out I told her I don't know if I would want to but maybe we could be friends. I have tried to be nothing but nice to her, I told her that I forgive her and that she doesn't need to feel guilty for feelings she can't control and the only mistake she mad was not telling me sooner. I then went on to say that there is still a place for her in my life as a friend if she would ever feel comfortable with that. I really wanted to keep things on good terms because our families are somewhat close and I still care about her. Unfortunately she never replied and now none of her family members will really talk to me. The last thing I heard from them was her mother telling me that my EX does not hate me. I felt better after we initially broke up but now I find myself getting very lonely at times. It feels like half the people that cared about me have just sort of disappeared. I saw her post a picture of herself yesterday and she looked very happy. I just don't understand how someone can go from caring about someone to forgetting about them so quickly. I have tried to surround myself with friends for the most part but I always know at the end of the day its just going to me sitting alone in my room wishing I had someone to talk to :/

I'm not super young and being in grad school means its hard for me to get out and meet new people. But, I do want to be with someone who is a good fit for me and not just tread water in a relationship that won't go anywhere.

My parents always tell me not to ignore gossip but my dads business relies on his reputation for being trustworthy. I'm worried what them running their mouths to everyone who will listen might do to him. My aunt in particular is acting like she's being the bigger person by not kicking up a fuss. She says stuff like ""It's a shame even family doesn't treat you right these days but Jesus said to turn the other cheek. Guess all we can do is pray on 'em."" It's not their fault she didn't think of or couldn't afford renovating! The house didn't have whatever value she thinks she lost UNTIL they put it in!

Early on in the quarter--before either of us knew when our finals were--we talked about carpooling for Spring break (she doesn't have a car here), but no definite plans were made. To me, it was more of a ""if it works out"" conversation, but she took it as firm plans. The conversation wasn't even about carpool plans, but what we would do over Spring break and she said ""we should totally carpool"" and I responded with ""maybe, we probably could"" and that was the end of it. We haven't seen much of each other this quarter, so we haven't talked about it in over two months. I had completely forgotten about this. It turns out I don't need to be here for finals week--which I literally found out yesterday--so I plan to go home next Friday the 11th whereas she has finals until the last day, Friday the 18th. She owes me some money, so last night I asked her if she could please get it to me before break, and she sent me back something along the lines of ""Sure! I'll be done with finals at 3 pm on the 18th so I can leave anytime after that :)"" When I told her I was planning to leave on the 11th, she said I needed to wait for her because we had plans and it was really uncool for me to leave her without a ride like that. We never had official plans to ride together and our school has a ride share site, so it's not hard to find other rides home. She would also be more likely to find someone who is closer to her; using the big city that is 300 miles west of us (which nearly everyone goes to/through) as a mid-point, I live 40 miles south of it whereas she's about 50 miles North. So depending on whether or not she can find someone to meet me near the middle, it adds an extra 40-100 miles to my trip. Is it shitty of me to not wait a week for her to finish finals given our ""plans?"" Would this actually be considered ditching her?

He dumped his ex (Keila - of three years) for me when I was only 17 years old. We were together for a year before he realized he was still in love with her. He went out one night and hung out with this girl who had the hots for him and didn't come home til 6AM. (Lydia) He broke things off with me, and spent the three months we were apart trying to get her back. All the while still talking to me, I eventually won him back. Fast forward two years, he's once again uphappy with our relationship and I catch him sneaking around talking to this this girl he grew up with, this stripper with two kids. (Hannah) He breaks things off again and proceeds to make a whole bunch of new ""friends"" (Jamie - 33) (Jessica-25?) (Stephanie-19) (Andra-27?) (Angela-26?) (Ariel-18) sleeping with me on and off until (Ariel) after two weeks he realizes he DOES love me and only wants to be with me. All of this in a span of four months. NOW, we have been back together since August 12, everything has been wonderful, except.... ALL OF THESE WOMEN ARE STILL ON HIS FACEBOOK. I've asked him to remove them, any time I see a post from them, or that they ""liked"" a status of his, or invited him to an event, it just reminds me of all the bad stuff that happened in my life, though it wasn't their fault, it was because of him. I love him very much, he was my first and is my only boyfriend. We are pretty darn happy now, rarely have serious arguments, we just found out we are expecting a baby. I just can't understand why he refuses to delete them. If he's not talking to them, why have them there? I'm TRYING to trust him, after all the bullshit he's done.

I've always been a relationship type... Never got into the whole hook up culture during college. However, the only person I've ever continuously slept with whom wasn't my boyfriend gave me genital HSV1. We hadn't even had sex that night because neither of us had a condom and me thinking I was being safe by doing everything but with him, landed me with an std. After I was swabbed and my results came back positive for HSV1 he informed me that he got coldsores from time to time and I guess one was on its way the night he went down on me. I know the stigma attached around the word herpes is god awful. I havent been with anyone since only because im terrified to tell someone about my condition. I am fully aware that the transmission rates are low, that the virus is more common to have than not to have and that in hindsight having HSV1 is really not a big deal. I just want to know if anyone has had ""the talk"" with someone before... How did you explain it to them and what was their reaction? I'm such a social, outgoing person and whenever I meet someone who I feel has the potential of becoming closer to me, or who I could see myself catching feelings for I push them away because I know that at some point I'm going to have to tell them and I don't want their perception of me to be altered.

This is a throw for obvious reasons - he is on reddit too! :( I am in my second year of Univeristy and he is doing a post grad course at the same uni. We live with mutual friends. I have been with him for about 8 months and in that time I have caught him cheating once before through sending messages and pictures. I was distraught but didn't want to lose the relationship. So I stupidly stuck with him. Time has passed and we've had our arguments here and there and I came to the conclusion with some help of friends he doesn't know that he is an emotional manipulator. With this in mind, I carried on with the relationship like normal and he seemed to be ok. About two weeks ago he started acting a bit distant towards me and I had suspicions he was cheating again. He had left his laptop open on a social media account with a conversation open with the guy he cheated on before with talking about sending more pictures and more crude messages. When he came back in the room I pretended I hadn't seen it. It has now been 3 days and I've not said anything. Obviously I am too scared to say anything since I invaded HIS privacy and went on his facebook. I can't stay with him though since he has now cheated twice. Help!

**Disclaimer: we're both Gay** My boyfriend and I just had a fight. Basically, I'm not comfortable with him cuddling with his friends, because of the potential sexual/intimate connotations attached to it. For context: I have a diaper fetish and like to use pacifiers and other baby items at times. He allows me to continue to do this despite the fact that it makes him uncomfortable; citing the fact that he loves me and trusts me enough not to take it too far. However, I've posited to him that the difference between my choosing to wear diapers and his choosing to cuddle with this friends is that what I choose to do involves only myself as an individual; whereas his cuddling involves another individual. He is now saying that if he can't cuddle with his friends, then I can't wear diapers.

I am going to talk to the mother of my child this Saturday to inform her of what I have done and what to expect. She still needs to be served and I want her to know before hand so she is not blind-sided. I feel a bit more confident and am now just getting ready for the mediation hearing. If she agrees to joint physical then we just need to get our times figured out and get it signed by a judge. If she doesn't agree then we will go into mediation at which point I will get legal representation. I will update you all on how she takes the news, hope she doesn't freak out on me and that she realizes this is just about me protecting my rights as a father being able to spend quality parenting time with our son.

I'll attempt to keep this brief and to include all important information This is my Girlfriends first real relationship, we moved in together very quickly after getting together and things as of the last few weeks have been spiralling quickly downwards. We have always been to talk very openly about our relationship and about each other. As of late she has lost trust in me and she catches herself questioning everything I say, she is worried to open up to me as she is concerned I will get annoyed or upset. She has a history of depression and panic attacks neither of which have been a problem until recently, now its usual to have ~3 panic attacks a day which is taking a toll on her health physically and mentally. She hasn't been eating and when she does it results in her throwing it all back up. She has nobody she feels comfortable opening up to and refuses to seek professional help as she has 'done it all before'. We both want this relationship to work and she knows the situation at the minute isn't healthy for either of us. She can see that it is taking its toll on me also now which just upsets her even further. She recognises that she doesn't balance the relationship with the rest of her life (work/study/friends/family) as I do leaving an in-balance in the relationship. She recognises it would help if she could balance her life better and not be 100% consumed by the relationship. I want to make sure she has somebody she can talk to outside of the relationship as I think it will help her get her thoughts straight. What can I do or say to help her?

I started hooking up with this guy a little while ago, a really nice dude that I got along with really well. We had nothing in common at all, but could talk for hours about everything and we have the same goofy-but-mature vibe going on I suppose. We both liked each other but had to keep it light cuz there was a post-graduation expiration date. He ended it after a few weeks but we decided to stay friends. We talked about it twice, where he admitted that he thought I liked him more/would expect more from him after we graduated and ended it early because he didn't want to hurt me by not wanting the same thing, and he thought it would be better if we weren't romantically involved ""for now"". But he said that he really wants to keep in touch even though we haven't known each other for that long (about 2 weeks before we started hooking up) because he enjoys talking to me and doesn't feel that way about a lot of people. He said he likes me as a person and cares about what happens to me in the future, and got mad at me when I questioned him, telling me adamantly that I just had to trust that he meant what he said. I know it sounds like he's feeding me lines, but we talked about this for three hours and I really do believe him when he says he cares. I told him that I wanted to keep in touch too but I didn't know if I could because I still liked him while he obviously had managed to set all of that aside, so he said he would leave it up to me. I really do want to, he's such a great guy, but I know now is not the time for that. But I don't want to cut him out or ignore him and make him feel like the things he said didn't mean anything to me because they do. Is it rude if I wait a few months to contact him? Do I need to tell him that that's what I want to do or can I just drop him a line to say hi later on?

My girlfriend and I have been together since my junior year in high school( for a total of 8 years). Her mother passed away due to cancer about 4 years ago. Her mother was what really held her family together and once she passed, everything kind of fell apart. Her father has had multiple DUI's has spent time in prison and is overall verbally abusive (has been physically abusive to her brother and was to her mom sometimes). After his last DUI he moved down to Mexico for a little over a year. Back in August, they got the news he was headed back home and my girlfriend freaked. She was considering getting an apartment on her own, but my family happily took her in and she has been living with me since. Since then we have found out the reason he is moving back is because her fathers brother was murdered by the Cartel down in Mexico..( sounds insane I know). Her whole family has been curious about his drug use based on how he has acted before( extremely paranoid). I don't know the exact details, but it is believed he was either dealing drugs or helping manufacturer them. She originally wanted no contact and nothing to do with him, but every time the year is about to end( when her mother died) she starts to become closed off and changes dramatically. She wants to try to fix things with her father and form some kind of new relationship with him. I strongly disagree with her. I have told her as long as he is alive I will have nothing to do with him. Period. Am I being unreasonable? I understand her longing for another parental figure in her life, but he drags everything and every one down with him. I unfortunately have given her an ultimatum, him or me. What should I do?

Ive been with my GF for nearly 3 months and while i as very happy at first i have been debating in my head what to do I don't feel like we have really advanced at all, i know she if very uncomfortable with any sort of physical contact but she isn't even willing to try any of that sort of stuff and i cant even do anything 'romantic' with her. The lack of physical contact is making it really difficult for me and sometimes making me sad but i immediately become happy again after ive seen her in the day, i dont know if i even understand my own emotions. Another large problem is that just about every one of my friends in college are also good friends with her so even if i did split from her, i don't know how i could continue to be around my friends as she would be there as well and i don't know how that could make me feel. I just need some sort of feedback from here, this is a really difficult situation, if i stay i may have a relationship which never evolves, if i leave its possible il have just about no one to talk to in college :( Also i still like her so much even regardless of lack of progress and i dont know how i could keep going with her.

My currently long distance girlfriend and I were talking on the phone tonight. She was telling me about the rather large payments owed on her credit card bill (which she does have the money in her account to pay off). After she told me I simply said in a sweet tone of voice ""I'm sorry you have debt sweetie"" to which she very angrily replied ""I don't have any debt"". Quickly this discussion took on a negative tone, and I escalated the situation by pointing out she had thousands of dollars left to pay on her new Audi as well and asked her why the word debt set her off so much. Long story short, she ended up telling me that I ""just didn't understand the type of image she was trying to project of herself"" and that ""she takes great pride in managing her finances very well"" My whole point throughout the debate (argument whatever we didn't yell or scream or anything) was that I thought she was over reacting, but even if this did upset her I wish she told me that before simply being mean and angry towards me about it. I should add throughout the argument I did say something to the effect of ""normal people wouldn't get angry at such a small thing"" which really pissed her off (but I believe to be fairly true). So reddit, how can I be a better boyfriend to her? On one hand, I feel like I am constantly trying to be sweet, fulfill her requests (she likes to talk every night before bed), and generally be there for her. On the other hand, she pretty much hates me over this sort of thing and threatened to leave me again tonight. I love her with all my heart. Am I in the wrong?

So I just graduated from college, I was the only one in my entire family to do so. I have been on my own since I graduated high school and never asked anyone to support me. I always had jobs during school so I never had to ask for anything, and I always made trips back home for major holidays. Anyway- I invited my whole family to come to my graduation, moms side and dads side. My moms side I know better because I lived in the same state as them. My dads family I hardly know, but I invited them as well. I got cards from them which was nice and I greatly appreciate them even doing anything since most of them never met me. Anyway- I sent everyone on my moms side cards and invitations (These are the people I grew up with and knew as my family my whole life) Well My aunt has been in a huge fight with my mom for the past two years, which has caused a lot of drama between my mom and her along with other members of the family. Anyway - I sent out invitations to everyone and the only people who came to my graduation was my mom and dad. I didn't even get a card or a congratulations from anyone from my moms family. It really hurts and I feel like the main reason is because of this fight between my mom and her sister. I don't know what to do, I feel like my entire family just blew me off- not caring about something that was so important to me. I even called my grandmother and expressed I was upset she didn't come to my graduation and she just shrugged it off like it didn't matter and cut the phone call short. I dunno I just need advice I guess? And yes - everyone had received the invitations, it wasn't a situation that it got lost in the mail or anything.

So my friend was drunk when he received texts from a girl currently out of the country. She professed a deep love for him out of the blue and says how she wants to be with him forever, etc, etc... My friend being drunk said some things he didn't mean, and woke up the next morning regretting what he said. But then the girl started texting him booty-pics, and telling him how badly she wants to fuck, etc, etc... This was all pretty much unprompted by him. Now my buddy is fully aware that this girl is acting crazy, but has told me he plans to have sex with her because she wants it so badly, and then just ""see what happens"". He has absolutely *no* interest in a relationship with her, which is what she clearly wants. I've told him that what he is planning is definitely a little rapey, and that he shouldn't do it, but he insists that it is fine because she wants to have sex so badly (Which is true-- but under false pretenses). I told him that he should come out with the truth and admit he was drunk, and tell her that he isn't looking for a relationship but is willing to have some fun. Currently waiting for a reply from him. I'm doing my best to stop this whole thing from happening, but in the meantime, what do you think of the situation?

As the title suggests, we've been together for a very long time. We met when we were kids and have been together ever since, and the love is still there: he makes me very happy, and I can't imagine life without him. Unfortunately, we've taken somewhat different paths in life. I started working when I was 17, and I've now graduated college and gotten a decent paying ""real job"". He left college after his first year and hasn't really been doing much else since then, except for hobbies and a brief stint as a cook. I pay for essentially everything: rent, bills, food, entertainment, etc, and while I'm totally okay with that, I feel like I'm doing him a disservice. He helps around the house, and I love being able to come home from work to spend time with him, but I worry that by supporting him like this I'm impeding his growth as a person. I want to encourage him to start hitting milestones, be it by entering the workforce or going back to school, but I don't want to be his parent, and I don't want to endlessly nag him... I'm just not sure he has the drive to do it on his own.

We've been together about 10 years, married about 5. She's always been overweight (BMI 30+) and while I wasn't enthused about that it was never a huge problem for me (no pun intended) since I really enjoyed my time with her. I was very thin when we met (BMI of around 19.5) and have since filled out to a much better BMI of 22. Over the past 3-4 years we've had a whole slew of problems that have lead to me resenting her for many things. During all this I started to improve myself and focus on eating healthy and working out. During this time I encouraged her to join me as I was concerned about seeing my wife get sick and immobile like her parents as she ages due to the obesity. She lost a lot of weight during these times (got down to 29 BMI, so only rated overweight) mostly due to stress, and she gained half of it back after the stressful situation no longer consumed her. I'm still trying to get her into eating healthy (since that's 80% of weight loss) and she clearly can't handle it, eating entire packages of cookies in one sitting, getting ice cream or some other sweets every few days, eating half a pizza in one sitting. To be fair I do those things sometimes too, but very infrequently and I watch my weight and I never gain more than 5 lbs. Ever since we've experienced the problems that caused resentment I am fully grossed out by her weight. If she wears a skirt I almost cringe when I see her tree trunk legs with all the fat dimples in them. When we have sex I get super grossed out by her gut. This used to not be a problem, but ever since we had all those issues I can't seem to look past her weight issues. I used to think of her and smile and now I think of her and get grossed out. Is there any way to get back to those old feelings without her losing weight, because I just don't see that happening.

Hello Reddit! I need help dealing with my son's school system, which seems to have become a little irrational with its ""zero strike"" policy. My son, Max [8M], was at school the other day and there's a new student named Sam [8M]. Apparently a bunch of kids were all around talking and getting to know each other and making jokes, and my son told Sam: ""You're a homo... a homo *sapien*!"". Or something like that. Just a clever little quip that the ""gang"" all says to each other. Apparently Sam went home crying and now the school has suspended my son for two days. I think this is absolutely ridiculous, as Max is a good kid and he was just trying to help Sam join the group by making a joke the same way Max and his friends make jokes with each other. I don't want this to go on my son's record, and I'm thinking about getting my lawyer involved. This whole thing has been hugely detrimental for Max's self esteem, who has been having a hard time anyways because his mother has been working abroad for a few weeks. I don't want to stress him out, which would negatively impact his schoolwork. The administrator says that the school has a ""zero tolerance policy"" towards bigotry, and Sam's mother says that Sam has been throwing up every morning before school because he doesn't want to get picked on. Reddit, what should my next step be?

*Insert mandatory comment about how this is my first time posting on reddit and will keep it short* As a small backstory, earlier this year, I was extremely unhappy with my job at the time (verbal abuse, other bad things) and had started making efforts to find new employment. This triggered my friend (as mentioned in title, who is currently my boss) to tell me that his job was hiring, and strongly encouraged me to apply. We had be friends for a little over a year, and I trusted his opinion, applied and got hired! This was great, or so I thought. Fast forward to now, working with friend/boss is completely miserable. He constantly talks down to me, belittles my intelligence (we work for an auto parts distributor, and i'm an avid car enthusiast, so I know my stuff), and also has crossed a couple lines for friendship and work relationship (buying flowers, offering to take me to dinner and such). It also does not help that this company is rather stingy and frugal with their workers, and I work much harder than what I get paid for. Now we get to the fun part. There was a time when the main company had threatened to close our branch, effectively letting go all of our employees, myself included. During this time, I had placed applications in numerous different job fields, hoping anything would come back. I went on a few interviews, and JUST YESTERDAY heard back from one that I had gotten the job. Since the interview process, my current job has returned to being stable, aside from the uncomfortable-ness from working with my boss. My effective start date is January 25, 2016 and I'm not sure how to bring this up without hurting my friendship.

Thirteen months ago I met this girl and we became sort of a ~~no~~^few- strings-attached sort of deal, we'd spend a lot of time together and act like we were in a relationship while we technically could still talk to other people. After a few months she got tired of that and refused to continue unless we officially became an item. I accepted, knowing it wasn't what I wanted. I'd just gotten out of a series of three, year-long^(approx.) relationships when we met and I wanted a break to just date lots of girls without committing to anything. I agreed to make it official with this girl because I do like her and partly because I was afraid I'd never find anything better. Now it's been a year since we started acting like a couple and 4 months since we've actually been a couple and I am unhappy, but can't decide if it's just 'the grass is greener on the other side' syndrome. She hasn't done anything to warrant a breakup, but I am tired of being tied down, and want to use these years while I'm just a kid to have fun and date lots of different girls. On the other hand, I may very well regret leaving her since we are quite compatible with each other. Also note I literally have no friends. I'm good with girls I know, but not good at approaching them or meeting new ones.

I went to a Genteens club with a few friends during university. I never told my girlfriend of two years I went. She had to find out from someone else. I know what I did is wrong and horrible. I don't deserve her. She has begun to loose my trust. I love her and I made a terrible mistake. She loves me we want to spend the rest of our lives together even though we are barely 19. I have done nothing else. I just want to know if there's anyway things can change. If I can do something to make her trust me again. I just want a place to vent or if anyone has similar stories.

So to begin with, we have been in a relationship for almost a year. Before this, we were close friends through highschool for about four years and have always had a thing for eachother. We began our relationship last year when he left school, and I'm still finishing. So, at the start of our relationship, we knew and established we are both very jealous people. In previous relationships, we felt really jealous of our respective partners, and often came to comfort of eachother to vent. We are both aware, too, of our past's, which arn't really full of clean track records (we've both been unfaithful to some extent in previous relationships, however, not that serious and we were both like 14). This isnt to say that this effects us now, we have both moved past that - but, it has left us both quite controlling. And at the start, it worked. If I was uncomfortable with something, he wouldn't do it. If he was uncomfortable with something, I wouldn't do it. But it's gotten to the point now where we feel like we are missing out on things. And we both WANT to change, I cannot stress that enough. This isn't a post asking for reasons to end it, I just really need advice for both of us to sort out our feelings and what steps we can take to learn from this and move on.

So I (M 23) need some advice. I have an amazing girlfriend (F 22) who has an amazing job. We have been dating for a little over a year now. Shes extremely smart, caring, and generous. Shes the first girlfriend whos ever gonw out of her way to do things for me. And I know thats normal for relationships but after being a rescuer for so long, shes the first one who's done anything for me. Shes extremely supportive and I could go on. The bottom line is if I do something to lose her I would be one of the most stupid men alive. So right now were far apart while im taking an intense course and I have no time to see her. I am one of two people taking this course seriously and that other person is a girl (F 24). I dont get along with pretty much anyone else because I dont go out with them every weekend. I love my girlfriend and no matter what nothing will ever happen. BUT. I have such a close connection with this girl. I always want to be around her and I want her to want to be around me. I hate seeing her unhappy so im always worried about her and its even affecting my ability to focus. These feelings confuse me because I know I would never cheat on my girlfriend 100% but I still feel guilty and Shitty and unfaithful. Ive always been touchy feely and always want someone to lean against when we watch a movie together but in all seriousness it has no sexual underlying reasons. Without sounding shallow I dont even really find this girl attractive.... She's the only one who's taken the time to get to know me and this constant distraction is absolutely killing me. Am I a shitty boyfriend for wanting comfort while im so far away assuming there are LITERALLY no underlying sexual elements? If so how do I stop it, or a more appropriate question is what are some methods you suggest to help me move in the right direction for stopping it. Ill never cheat on her I know that I just feel so pathetic right now. Can anyone give me some advice?

Hello /r/relationships Let me start off by letting you guys and girls know that I had less than 5 relationship, my last being the longest (around 1 year and 4 months). I am the typical shy, friendly, nervous, and genuinely a nice guy, that gets Friend-Zone A LOT. I tried to improve, but have little luck on it, even from friends advice. Most of them said I don't have a good pick up skills, which I probably agree on. It sucks since I lost quite a few chances with women I am interested in, around town or at college. One of my friends suggest me to watch movies, and some say to read articles/books, but don't have any suggestions, since most of them are good at it naturally and couldn't give me any pointers in my situations. What does /r/relationships recommend me to do? I wanna improve my chances. From talking to the girl, breaking the ice, improve my chances on getting dates, etc.

Hey Reddit, Ive got a questions about the best way to express feelings to a good friend of mine. Basically my friend [F26] is recently single, Ive known her for four years and realized I had feelings for her about 6 months ago. I haven't expressed much interest as she has been with someone and I wanted to respect that. Now that shes single I would like to at least let her know that I have some feelings for her (I missed my chance before she began dating her latest BF). I may loose her as a friend but if I dont tell her I feel that Ill regret it. I'm not a shy person, and I'm not socially awkward, I just have trouble letting my feelings known (its caused some regret in the past). So my question is this, for those that have been in this situation before how do you recommend doing it?

Throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my account name and I would rather not have another arguement. My girlfriends have recently spoken to me about my boyfriend. They think he hasnt matured beyond High School where we first started dating. They think I should leave him and date this weird builder my girlfriend is good friends with. They pointed out that he is 22 and still on any given day hes not at Uni can be found in his room at this shared house with all his mates, either jamming on instruments (Boyfriends a bassist), playing videogames, drinking beer and eating pizza, skating in the empty pool out back, listening to 90s pop punk, going to concerts and getting up to mischief. An example being the ramp bolted onto the guttering and wall so they can drop into the pool from the roof. (Theres a friend whos a tradesman who lives there). They also pointed out his sense of dress is embarassing to them and they dread him coming to a bar. One described it as ""Blink 182 chic"". Baggy knee length Dickies, Hurley and Atticus shirts and a backwards snapback with vans to cap it off usually. I dont personally see anything wrong with this to be honest To make it all worse my boyfriend found out about all this through one of the girls telling her boyfriend who lives with my guy and honouring his friendship told him, so hes very upset and angry. I just dont know whos side to take?! Is he immature and weird? Does he dress weird?! Is he right to be upset?! I just dont know what to do but having one of his friends tell me that in the 15 years hes known my guy this is the first thing hes seen him cry over is breaking my heart. HELP!

3 years back, when I was out drinking with some friends in a park, a large group of teenagers came over and, without provocation, started being physically aggressive. One of them pushed me over, and I landed on my arm and broke it. To this day, I still have limited mobility in my arm. This is a source of upset for me, because nobody wants to feel disabled, especially at such a young age. Anyway, my mother has never been particularly sympathetic about it all, partly because she does not drink alcohol and is pretty judgemental of those who do. I fractured a metatarsal (my foot) last week on a night out, and I was talking to her on the phone about it today. I said that I hoped there was nothing long-term in the injury, to which she said in this upbeat, mockingly righteous voice: 'well, you'll have to be more careful in the future'. 'You know that the common denominator is alcohol'. This got me annoyed, and I said 'I was assaulted the first time, it wasn't just an accident'. She replied 'well, if you hadn't been drunk, maybe you'd have caught yourself better'. I told her that she was really out of line, and that I was sensitive about this, expressing my annoyance. She responded by saying I was 'probably just tired'. I mean, I know this is an extreme comparison, but would you expect the mother of a rape victim to suggest that if they hadn't been drunk, it wouldn't have happened? I mean, it may be true (controversial), but it's not something that should be said by a family member! What annoys me even more is that she will never admit when she's done wrong. She'll just start guilting me, telling me 'she always does her best'. When I pushed her for some kind of apology, she said I was bullying her and hung up. Do I have a right to be upset with her? Should I just forget this, or should I hold the grudge? I don't know if I'm being unreasonable.

Hi reddit, as the title says I found out that my fiancé did porn 7 years ago, I am pretty chilled out about sex and I know everyone has a past but I simply don't find her sexy at all. Honestly the best thing I liked about her was that she was innocent and cute now I just don't see her in that way anymore, I'm still loving towards her because I thought I just needed time but now I know it's just not happening. Today I told her that I think we should hold off having the wedding and I think she knows what the problem is. I know it's not her fault because she didn't even know me then but I now know I can't marry her because she just isn't the same person in my eyes anymore, Has anyone been through what I have.

Relationship has been on for about 8 months. So I never like snooping through my gfs stuff. weather it be fb, texting whatever. But while we were chillen at her house, she brings up some fb messages I see a message from a guy and jokingly give her a hard time about it. She said you can read it so she opens it and scrolls up real fast. This makes me think shes hiding something so as I scroll down she makes a comment to this guy via message saying ""why did you cut your hot ass hair"". Follow by him responding with a frown face she then replies. ""Whats the face for babe?""

I've been with my boyfriend for a year now. He is a professor with a master's degree, working on a PhD. I, on the other hand, dropped out of college my sophomore year. I'm back in school now, though, and should graduate with a Bachelor's degree in two more years. I love that my boyfriend is so smart, but anytime I make a grammar/spelling/math mistake, no matter how small, he not only corrects me but laughs at me. For instance, I mispronounced a word the other day, and he wouldn't shut up about it for a solid three minutes or so. He laughed, and said I pronounced it the way ""someone who's only seen the word in books but has never heard it spoken"" would say it. Then he mocked me by saying the word the way I pronounced it a few times. He also likes to correct others as well. We play in a couple of role-playing games, and he had to point out that someone made a mistake by saying ""consecrated"" instead of ""desecrated"", and laughing about it. I told him that the way he was correcting people was rude, but he still does it all the time. My question is, what can I do to get him to stop? It makes him look like a jackass, but he's honestly a great person and I don't want people to get the wrong impression of him. Apparently, outright telling him that it's rude did not work.

I've been with this guy for almost four months, and we're very much in love. It's gotten pretty serious pretty quickly, but in a way that we're both comfortable with and that seems like it's going to last. He comes from quite a religious background, and while he isn't practicing his family is very religious, conservative, and judgmental. They live several states away and he is somewhat estranged from most of them. He hasn't told any of them about me yet, and the other day he told me that he probably won't ever tell them, unless we're about to get married (which isn't anytime soon). This bothers me, but I'm not really sure why, or if it should matter. I'm reasonably close with my family and he's met both my parents and sister, which he's been fine with and has gone well. He says that he just doesn't want to deal with his family's judgement, or questions about his personal life, which I get. But if I'm going to be part of his life long term, I feel weird about them not even knowing I exist. It makes me feel sort of insecure about our relationship and whether he feels as serious about it as I do. Is this something I should be worried about, or do I need to just learn to accept it? I know that I can't understand where he's coming from, since I've never had these kinds of problems with my family. Is it unfair of me to be stressed about this? Or is it a red flag for the relationship? I'd really like to hear thoughts!

I've lived in New York my entire life, and I love it here. I live in a big city north of NYC and I love everything about it. I have good friends and a boyfriend I adore. My parents have recently decided to put our house up for sale and move over to Arizona, which I feel would be a drastic change for me, and every time they have talked to me about it, they say they ""need"" me in Arizona with them, and that I'm going to love it there. I really don't want to move there. I have tried to have an open mind about it, but every possible outcome the cons outweigh the pros. It had been very difficult for me to make and keep friends, having a very tough high school experience and I've finally made some lasting bonds and to up and move would be the worst, especially with them all going to college. Plus I have my boyfriend, who I have an amazing connection with, he's even said I can move in with him (which I don't think I'd want to do because he lives in NJ and my parents would disapprove). I just graduated high school and am currently working this year part time, and planned to go to a local college next fall. My older siblings both live in NY and I have a strong connection with my sister, I couldn't bare being so far away from her. How can I make it work so that I don't have to move with them? Thing is, I don't know if I could afford my own place here (It's pretty expensive) and I'm not sure if I could live with my sister. Any advice on how to talk to them about it? My dad is very stern and insists he knows best for me, when he really has no clue/doesn't pay attention to my life. I'm scared of saying no to him and how he'll react. And while I'm technically an adult being 18, if I got cut off from them I'd have a very hard time getting by financially.

Been seeing him for two months we were friends before for a year. I was the one to ask him out and for two months it was always me that asked to go anywhere or I would tag along where he's going. I always have to hold his hands or else it wouldn't happen or message him first. So I just straight up asked him if he likes me he said yes but just feels like he has no interest or too busy to be interested in me. We didn't even kiss yet cause he won't do anything if I don't. I kissed on the cheek like last week I don't have much experience either, only dated one guy before him so I'm so lost.

Made throwaway for this. I'm currently in graduate school in NYC, and generally broke (or at least on limited income). I spent the summer working on a project in the UK and met an amazing woman. It was a beautiful 2 months together. We kept in touch and she decided to visit in early November. It was an amazing week and feelings only grew stronger, but we need to be realistic. She wants to try to make it work, but I just don't see any way this ends well. I'm spending another 2 years in school and have limited resources for visiting. She's a small business owner and has to run her store. Opportunities for us to visit are few and far between. Even worse, I'm likely to end up working in NYC and her business is taking off, meaning she's likely to stay. We connect so well but I don't think I can carry this on. I don't think I can take going months on end not knowing when we could see each other again, or even knowing if we could ever live together. Has anyone jumped into a long distance relationship like this? With so much uncertainty ? It seems to me that this can only end in heartbreak if we go any further. She really means so much to me.

This is pretty much the guy version of [this]( ) post except I respect what she wants. First of all, I think it's necessary to point out that distance is an issue between us as we're in different countries and she has depression. I'm extremely bad with recounting events so I'll just do a timeline. ____ Feb: We started off as friends July: Romantic connection established August: She decided to put me in the dreaded friendzone. I remain in this hole until... October: I asserted strongly to her that if I can't be anyone special in her life, we should probably part ways. She agreed and we stopped talking. December: She messages me saying she missed me so I thought we should start off again. The problem is, it's exactly how it was in August when I had been friendzoned. Her feelings for me have completely evaporated while mine still remain. I understand that we have to start from the beginning but when she asks about any potential girls I've been looking at that I might wanna marry and have kids with, hasn't she already defined the boundaries of this relationship?

There are 4 messages all together sent within a 9 minute time span. The first message, they tell me they have some info on my SO and warning me not to run to him with the news. The second message, they say they have proof. That my SO DMs and flirts with their friend in the city he use to live in. How she is telling me because girls have to stick together. Thrird message says that he blows up their friends facebook and asks for me to surprise him in person asking to check his facebook messages. Fourth message, they call my SO a loser and tell me I shouldn't be with him. (along with some more personal info about him) I'm wondering what should I do? I replied to them (a week later, which is today) asking for them to send me the proof they have, however, it seems like their account is a throwaway and that they will probably not get back to me.

Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks. I've been officially dating my girlfriend for almost three months. Before this we were hooking up for about a month before we put a title on it. I've dated before, but never have had a relationship as serious as this. This is my first ""serious"" relationship, and i'm not trying to rush anything. This girl just continues to blow my mind.

This is a throw away, I'm on mobile and all these names are fake. I don't even know where to begin because I was caught so off guard by this and have no idea how long it has been going on for. I have been in the army for 6 years, only going home twice a year and seeing my extended family for Christmas. There has been some family drama before, (brother is a drug addict and father is mentally ill), but nothing that has ever involved extended family. My cousin Kim [21f] and I had been very close growing up. Close enough that I'd even considered her a sister. While she was in high school she met Dave [21m]. They have been joined at the hip ever since. Because I only come home twice a year, I've really only met Dave a handful of times, but he comes to all my family's functions. So I have always treated him like family. I have been over this 1000 times and I still have no idea where these accusations are coming from but apparently Kim was extremely upset. •I have only met Dave at family functions •I have always been polite •I have never been alone with Dave, ever. •I have not been single during any of the times I had been home •I have never talked to Dave outside of family functions, or with out other family members present This has become a major issue. Now that I have moved back to my home state, I'd like to start going to more family functions. I have reached out to all of my extended family with out response and now I feel unwelcomed, and uninvited. I haven't been able to attend Thanksgiving in years and now I don't think I should. I feel rejected from my own family. If I really had done something to hurt someone I wish they would have just been honest and confronted me. I'd never do anything inappropriate or hurtful intentionally. Especially because I love Kim. She's amazing.

Hi guys, I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.

My fiance and I will be getting married in 8 weeks on our 3 year anniversary. Overall we get along amazingly, share the same interests, enjoy spending time together, laugh a lot, and rarely fight. We have sex often and we have both always been open about how much we enjoy the sex we have. That being said, I am always the one to initiate sex. I love this man, I love to be intimate with him, and I want him to feel good and know that he is desired. However, I also want him to show his desire for me and I don't feel as though he is doing it. We have a cycle in our relationship where I go months being the primary initiator, then I ask him to please try to make an effort to initiate more, he will initiate once, and then he goes back to never initiating. I think I have a fairly realistic grasp on sex in relationships and I definitely do not expect every sexual encounter to be ""magical"" and that there is nothing wrong with just having a quickie. I try to keep things interesting, I go out of my way to find alternatives to please him during shark week, and I feel as though I have been honest and open about my desires for him to initiate more and show more passion towards me. I don't really know what more I can do to convey the message that I need him to show an interest in me in this way because his lack of interest is making me feel hurt and undesirable. What can I do?

I'm sort of in an 'everything was a lie' type of mood after this revelation. Background is that he lives overseas while I live in the U.S. and I was introduced to him by my father via an online meeting. We started texting/having sporadic irl meetings, during which I made it clear to him from the start that I was unsure if I'd call us 'dating'. I wasn't prepared for a long distance relationship, but here we were 2 years later. He began pushing for marriage almost 2 months ago which raised my red flags, because I'd always mentioned how I didn't favor the idea of marriage. I casually mentioned it in conversations, and found out through various family members that my father set up the entire meeting/dates because bf is a wealthy businessman with income in the millions and he wanted me to get married to him. My father knows my view on marriage, and his past efforts of setting up 'potential boyfriends' always ended with me rejecting them. He set up these dates by many, MANY methods, some of which I can't even fathom (one includes having bf fake many of my interests.) I'm very peeved at the moment at the two of them because apparently bf knew from the get go that my father was 'arranging' a marriage and was fine with it. I'm having second thoughts over whether or not our relationship, or whatever it is, was real right now.

I do earn more than him, he's a high school english teacher, I'm a consultant. He's told me before in intimate conversations that he feels ashamed about this even though he knows he shouldn't.

The reason why I don't like her is both because she's the ex of an old friend of mine, and because I don't feel the ""spark"". She has been asking me every weekend for like two months if I want to do something, but I have declined with bad conscience every time. Today a common friend of our asked us and another girl to go see a movie together. I accepted the request because I really wanted to see that movie, and this girl asked me to. I really feel bad for disappointing her as much as I've done. We had a great time at the movie and everything and went home for ourselves afterwards. When I got home she started to chat with me on Facebook about what's wrong about ""us"" and everything. She just doesn't get why I don't wanna be with her (At least she pretends), so I started to agree. After a while she asked me to hang out tomorrow again, all by ourselves, but I had to come up with some bullshit story. I just figured that I can't continue to let her down, but she just don't want to take the hint... She is cute, funny, nice and everything but I just can't date or hang out with her.

We have been dating for 4/5 months (we are exclusive since 1 month) right off the bat said he was looking for a relationship etc. I was on the same page. Than he started a new job a month later to pay for school (he didn't want to be on a loan for school) I said I understood as I was in the same boat (working hard this summer to pay for school, we are mid twenties.) Anyways we've grown closer and Ive mad no mention of a relationship before. However I find myself really liking this guy and I am ready and open for a relationship. I told him this and He said he's priority was working lots and saving for school we should just take it slow/have fun. So I said (calmly) that if he didn't want the same thing I completely respect that but I hope he can respect my decision to move on so we can both find someone who wants the same things that we both want. I wished luck and left the apartment. His mouth was hanging open and I just left. He started blowing up my phone saying that he really liked me and didn't want to lose me, work was number one on his mind but he wanted to make it work with me and can't lose me and he just had a bad day at work and was stressed (I didn't know this) I haven't responded all this just happened last night. Im pissed off that he only wanted me when he thought he was going to lose me. How do I respond? I feel angry for some reason..

For a while now, more than a year, I've been unhappy in my marriage of almost 13 years. We've got two boys, a 9 year old and 4 year old. The 9 year old has recently started to notice the unhappiness which is one of the reasons last night I finally told her we needed to talk. As expected she didn't take the news very well. She got out of bed and went for a drive for about an hour. Then she came home and slept out in the living room. I laid in bed upset and having no idea what to do. This morning I got up to go to work and she wanted to talk finally. She asked what she could do to keep this from going any worse and I told her I didn't think there was anything. My mind is made up and I think I'm just ready to move on. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life but I want to stay strong and not change my mind thinking things are going to be any better later on. Now what the hell do I do? I'm absolutely lost here.

Me and my girlfriend have been living together for a while but since a while we are apart from eachother again. Atm we are not together but speak daily on whatsapp. She uses my fb account to see on her friends/families posts. But i have found out that she is checking daily a friends profile [20] (pictures of him). They know eachother like 1 year. I once jokily asked if she liked him but she said ofcourse not. She sees him every weekend when working together. I know she wouldn´t cheat on me, but the fact she lies to me hurts me. I dont want to be controlling her and i never did, but the fact i noticed this now makes me do it anyway. She is still normal to me and she didnt changed her behavior alot. She started checking on him since im gone.

Since I was young, I have been attracted to men aged age 30-50. I can't remember a time I'd ever had a crush on someone within my age range- anyone I've been attracted to has been at least 30 years or older, no exceptions, even when I was 10 or 11. Now at age 26, I am running into trouble with this preference. I have been involved with married men before, and most of the men I am attracted to turn out to be married. Which makes sense since they are between the ages of 40-50. I am NOT attracted to that sort of thing- they are not attractive to me because they're married. I'm attracted to them because they are older, paternal, and usually authoritative- and those men tend to already be married. To be clear, I am extremely self-aware of all of my behaviors and psychology. I know I am attracted to father figures because my own father was absent, and I always felt that hole in my heart, in my life, and now that's all I chase after. I always knew I was ""different"" from my peers and I have tried to pretend to be attracted to people my age. Unfortunately, it's never been real. I've tried to lie to myself, lie to my friends, force myself to change my attractions. I told my mother a few times about how I like older men and would like to marry someone 40-50 years old and she was horrified and told me it was a terrible idea, men die earlier, you'll be miserable, you don't want an old father for your children, it's not right, etc, etc. But I'm just exhausted. I like what I like. Is that okay? I want someday to marry a man who is older and paternal, but without any drama involved (married, affairs, etc.) It's all I long for.

My ex-boyfriend became violent with me one night and I called the police. He was charged with battery by strangulation. The trial was *hell* but is now donewith. I am still struggling with the typical ""I deserved it"" mindset that most victims go through. It was the first and last time he attacked me. He would be a dick sometimes but I never expected he would hurt me. He hasn't tried to contact me or anything, but I am having a really hard time still living in the same city. We had all the same friends and I lost *all* of them because of this incident. I see people we know everywhere when I go out and it ruins my self-worth knowing I lost my entire friend's group because of what he did to me. This was the first time anything like this had ever happened to me. I have never been called a name by a guy let alone had one try to basically kill me. To give some background, I had moved to the area for the university and became good friends with the whole group. They knew him much longer therefore when everything happened, they kind of sided with him. All the guys think I deserved what happened because I was in his face yelling. They all saw the injuries he left on me in person and through photos. I feel like I have this huge stigma attached to me. It's fucked with me a lot. Also, without going into much detail, he is *very* well-known for his artwork in the city. People love him and respect him and I see it everywhere and hear people talk about it. I feel like the memory is just always looming around. Part of me wants me to move but the other part feels like that is weak of me to do. I feel like I should be stronger and not let what he did effect my life so much. Some of them still contact me but I just don't want anything to do with anything related to him. Would it be best to completely cut contact with everyone and just move to a different city? Thank you so much if you have read this.

She says she's been happier without me than with me, and that ""I'm sorry but I don't think we are gunna get back together anytime soon to be honest i'm sorry"" So now what do I do? Should i stop trying to communicate with her and move on? I don't want to lose her, I really do love this girl, I just want to have my best friend back. We did everythign together, her mom also passed away from cancer 2 years ago while we were together. I was not ready to let this all go, but should i?

I recently started working at a summer internship and naturally began meeting lots of people. Lots of good looking college women to be specific. So here I am, mid flirtatious conversation with the hottest girl in the department when out slips ""my boyfriend...yada yada yada"". I tried not to look immediately disappointed but the smirk slipped right off my face. Now every time she comes to my desk to talk about what I'm doing on the weekend I keep thinking about how I've been cheated on and don't want to cause any complications. Although I can tell she can tell that I'm being stand off-ish and I'm afraid she thinks I'm being rude. I've stopped complimenting her on how good she looks, stopped IMing her, stopped eating lunch alone together. Is that just the price you pay for being in a relationship? No flirting with the guys at the office? Or am I just being a dick...

We were together for about 10 months - a healthy, happy, loving and caring relationship from start to finish - and he recently moved in with me. Ultimately the breakup wasn't very volatile: We want different things in different cities, and don't want to hurt one another by failing to live our truths and become the best people we can be... even though that means separating by thousands of miles, and not being together any more. Our conversations have been mature and honest, but while he is devastated -- alternately sleeping on the couch and sobbing in my arms -- I am... relieved? And maybe even a little excited, and actively holding myself back from contacting other people I had crushes on during the relationship, all before he's even figured out where he will go when he leaves my apartment. Obviously I've been checked out of the relationship for some time, and have already gone through lots of the grieving process prior to the actual breakup. But I feel like a sociopath for watching someone I loved, and will absolutely always love, be in so much pain while I have yet to even cry (and don't feel like I'm going to). What gives? Am I emotionally stunted, or is the grief only going to hit when he's actually gone, or something else?

I'm a full time student and I work part time as a freelance writer. We are engaged and we have a lot of 24/7 BDSM aspects to our relationship (we are kinky fucks, okay?). He has suggested the idea of me stopping working or cutting way back and focusing on school. He will support me during that time and in return I'll get good grades and graduate on time as well as doing all/most chores and cooking (don't mind at all). He also wants me to coupon, and I'm cool with that. I just feel guilty accepting the help. He really seems like he wants to, and his income can definitely allow for this. Together for 11 months.

My boyfriend and I met in college and have been dating for 2.5 years. He's a senior at school now and I graduated and moved away for a job. We've been doing long distance for the past 6 months (and have done long distance successfully in the past) but about 2 months ago he told me he wasn't happy in his life or at school without me there. He's dealt with depression before so I thought it was part of that...but he says now that he just doesn't feel the same excitement/passion in our relationship as he did in the beginning, even when we did long distance the first time. He says he wants to do everything he can to try to make it work. He's meeting with a therapist to try to sort through everything and see what it is that's making him feel like this because he says he wants to be happy with me. He says he really wants to be with me and can't imagine his life without me. I don't feel the way he feels, he still makes me happy and I still have so much fun in our relationship. He's been trying to figure stuff out for 2 months and still nothing's changed, do I keep waiting around for him to figure out if he wants to be with me? We both want the relationship to work so badly. Is it it even possible to get the excitement and passion back in your relationship that you had in the very beginning like he wants? Do you think he'll ever be really happy with me again or has our relationship just run it's course?

I have known this girl since I was in 6th grade. We went to a small middle school so every knew everyone at that school. I wouldn't say we were good friends just acquaintances. From 6th to 8th we went to school together. For high school we went to separate schools and i didn't even talk to her at all during that time. I am now in college and we happen to go to the same college and live in the same housing building. I see her every once in a while and she'll come up to me and hug me and say hello. We have never had a long conversation just hello and a hug, today she asked my how my day was, idk if i'm reading into but people don't usually ask how your day was unless they are interested. It seems weird for me because we never really talked and she hugs me like we've known each other before. I want to try and pursue a relationship but i don't want to text her randomly and seem like i just started to text her for a relationship. How can i pursue this girl?

We've been dating for a little over a year now and we have a pretty ok relationships. But there are times when we need to talk about our feelings and go into a deep discussion about it. But when this happens I feel my throat closing up and my brain basically shutting down all my vocals. Its like there's a wall over my voice and I cant get around it. I get anxious the second before I do bring myself to try to say something but all I can manage to get out is a small squeak or mumble. There are things I do need to tell him but I cant bring myself to say anything. Is there anyway I can work past this that would be easy on me? Cause I really would like to tell him whats on my mind, without my mind blocking me from doing so.

Hello, I am here to give Reddit a chance to make my mom happy for the first time in nearly 20 years. I know the internet is full of people who will try to scam or the ones who are only here for their libidos, however I am tired of seeing my mother unhappy and I would appreciate it if you left now if you happen to be one of those people. I will try to explain what has been going on and hopefully someone here can help me. My mother is 44 and she has been married to basically a psychopath for about 20 years. He is antisocial, and after living with him we are quite sure he suffers from the paranoid personality disorder, but I am unable to help him because he is very ignorant and hateful when it comes to him being the troublemaker. My mother and him had one child, here I am trying to find someone who will respect my mother and show her that she can also be happy. My father has been emotionally abusing me and my mother ever since I was very little (abusive lang, making us feel worthless) and also used to sometimes physically abuse my mother where I remember her thumb being broken and many bruises. My mother however has always supported him in every way just because she had thought he would make her happy in the end, also because she didn't have support from anyone else and she couldn't afford to leave him with me. My father has now made her work in another country for 4 years simply because he doesn't want her to be with him. And I am just in the middle, hoping for a miracle for my mothers happiness. If you know someone or if you are the one who can help me, please feel free to do so. It would be much appreciated. Also leaving comments such as ""Why doesn't she just divorce?"" Really doesn't help. We are not financially strong enough and it takes too long to get what we deserve. We are trying but we are unsure how things will turn out. Thank you for reading.

I love him and he loves me. But I think we're headed for divorce, either in the immediate future or within a year. Nothing is set in stone yet. Nobody outside the relationship knows. We can put a good face on it. When school starts in fall the amount of other business to attend to will skyrocket, and therefore it will be a bad time to be seperating. Also I am not 100% sure. Not 100% sure, and he is very very clear that there will be no trial separation. Once the trigger is pulled, there is no turning back. We have time to be civilized about it now. I want to go on the trip as planned, because we have been looking forward to this and plan to be ticking off a few items on my bucket list. If I don't, I will probably never see my in-laws on this side again. I like them a lot.

My brother is a despicable scumbag. He just is, there's no way to sugar coat this. It's a fact. He's a habitual liar, he still lives with our mom, he steals money from her and sells her belongings, he doesn't work, and he's an addict. I can't stand this man, being around him for even 5 minutes makes me sick. People can't believe we are related; we are so different. He's an embarrassment to our family, and no one can trust him. Things go missing constantly. Our mom takes way too much pity on him, tries to keep him happy by giving him everything he wants, and he's simply an ungrateful asshole. My other brother (27/m) detests him as well and wants nothing more to do with him. We hate to see him abusing our mother like this. It's wrong. It's just wrong. Here's the thing, he doesn't want anyone's help. Our mom is an enabler, and won't make an effort of her own to help him. She just placates him and not much else. Is there anything I can do? Unlike our brother, me and my (27/m) brother have our own homes and jobs. He (35/m) claims he doesn't need our help and that our mom doesn't see the problem and that WE are the problem instead.
